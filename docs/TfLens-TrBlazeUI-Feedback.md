> ## ✅ RESOLVED LIBRARY-SIDE 2026-09-14 — TR-039 and TR-040
>
> Filed by TfLens against 2.0.6; the entries themselves live in the TfLens copy of this file. Both
> were reproduced on the unchanged library first, then fixed. REQ-UI-008 (TR-039) and REQ-UI-002
> (TR-040) are re-verified. Release build **0 warnings / 0 errors**; **20/20** headless-Chromium
> checks in `tests/verify/req-ui-020.spec.ts`. Both fixes are in the next release after 2.0.6.
>
> | Entry | What was actually wrong | What you get |
> |---|---|---|
> | **TR-039** — leaving a chart page logs an unobserved `JSDisconnectedException` | Confirmed: one per chart (5 on `/charts/bar`, 4 on `/charts/pie`, 5 on `/verify-tflens-3`, 0 on a page with none). Blazor-ApexCharts' `Dispose` starts the module release and never awaits it; 7.0.0 is the same. | All six chart types draw through `DisconnectSafeApexChart`, whose teardown ignores a closed connection. Measured: 0 after leaving each page. |
> | **TR-040** — `InputGroupInput` has no `DebounceMilliseconds` | Confirmed exactly as filed. | `InputGroupInput.DebounceMilliseconds`, the same behaviour as `Input`'s. Measured: typing `escaped` raised 1 call with it; 3 keys without it raised 3. |
>
> TR-039 needs nothing on upgrade. For TR-040, give the `/misses` filter back `DebounceMilliseconds="150"`.

> ## ✅ RESOLVED LIBRARY-SIDE 2026-09-13 — TR-036, TR-037 and TR-038
>
> All three were reproduced on the unchanged library first, then fixed. REQ-UI-001 (TR-036) and
> REQ-UI-020 (TR-037, TR-038) are re-verified. Build **0 warnings / 0 errors**; **70/70**
> headless-Chromium checks (`tests/verify/ui-tflens-3.spec.js` on `/verify-tflens-3`) at 1280 and
> 390, and the TR-028 to TR-035 checks still **37/37**. Evidence: `docs/TrBlazeUI-Checklist.md`,
> ledger `docs/.last-verify.json`.
>
> | Entry | What was actually wrong | What you get |
> |---|---|---|
> | **TR-036** | Confirmed: leaving `/components/select` with the list opened logged 1 unhandled circuit exception. The same unguarded release was in five more places: `DropdownMenuContent`, `PopoverContent`, `SheetContent`, `FocusManager` and `PositioningService`. | All six now ignore a closed connection when releasing their scripts. Measured: 0 exceptions after leaving the select, dropdown menu and popover pages with the popup open. |
> | **TR-037** | Confirmed exactly as filed. The built-in series behind `Items`/`XValue`/`YValue` was never told to show labels, and ApexCharts takes that switch from the series. | All six chart types now pass the final decision to that series. `ShowDataLabels`, `Options.DataLabels.Enabled` and `OptionsConfigurator` each draw labels in the short form. Measured: 3 labels per route, formatted `12.1M`/`37.1M`/`1.6M` through the configurator, 0 on a chart that asks for none, and pie labels too. Your nested-series workaround can go. |
> | **TR-038** | Confirmed, and your audit was right: `text-ellipsis`, `text-clip`, `text-wrap`, `text-nowrap`, `text-balance` and `text-pretty` all fell into the colour group. | They now have their own groups. Measured: all 7 `Badge` variants keep their colour under `Truncate` and `Wrap`. `Outline` + `Truncate` carries `text-foreground` again. |
>
> **Two things to know before upgrading.** A short-form chart that already passed `ShowDataLabels`,
> `Options.DataLabels.Enabled` or a configurator will now actually show its labels. And an element
> given one of the six text utilities above next to a text colour now keeps both. `DataLabels.Enabled`
> is a plain true/false in ApexCharts, so `ShowDataLabels="true"` switches labels on even when your
> `Options` brings its own `DataLabels` object; it never switches them off.
>
> **Please re-test and reopen anything that still bites.**

> ## ✅ RESOLVED LIBRARY-SIDE 2026-09-12 — TR-028 … TR-035, the eight filed after the reply below
>
> Triaged and fixed against current source under **REQ-UI-020**. Release build **0 warnings /
> 0 errors**; **37/37** new headless-Chromium checks (`tests/verify/ui-tflens-2.spec.js` on
> `/verify-tflens-2`) plus **15/15** row-mapped acceptance tests (`tests/verify/req-ui-020.spec.ts`),
> with every runnable regression suite still green — `ui-tflens` 44/44, `ui-techieblog` 76/76,
> `ui-ui016` 23/23, `ui-demo-2-1-0` 15/15, `ui-ui014` 8/8, `ui-ui004` PASS desktop+mobile. 0
> console/page errors and 0 horizontal overflow at 1280 and 390. Evidence:
> `docs/TrBlazeUI-Checklist.md` REQ-UI-020, ledger `docs/.last-verify.json`.
>
> **Seven were real and are fixed. One (TR-030) was already fixed and needs an upgrade, not a fix.**
>
> | Entry | What was actually wrong | What you get |
> |---|---|---|
> | **TR-028** | `BarChart` and its five siblings had no route to `ApexChartOptions` at all, and each type overwrote `Grid`/`Xaxis`/`Yaxis` unconditionally. `ChartContainer` painted a Card with no way off. | **`Options`** (merged *over* the wrapper's defaults) and **`OptionsConfigurator`** (runs last, for formatters) on every chart type; **`ChartContainer.Bare`**. Measured: 5 gridlines / 2 borders / 5 y-labels → **0/0/0**, bars still drawn, and a chart passing no `Options` unchanged. |
> | **TR-029** | Confirmed. In a 180px box the label became 3 lines at 54px inside a **33,554,432px** radius — the end caps really were cutting into the text. | **`Badge.Wrap`** (pill grows, left-aligned, 8px radius) and **`Badge.Truncate`**. ⚠ The default is now one line that overflows rather than a silent broken shape. |
> | **TR-030** | **Could not reproduce.** `CollapsibleTrigger` has had a `Class` parameter since 2.1.0 — you filed against 2.0.0. Measured live: `Class="w-full text-left"` lands on the real `<button>`, which then fills its 502px row with the badge flush right. | Upgrade and drop the `::deep` rule. The shrink-to-fit default is kept deliberately (widening every existing trigger would break layouts silently); the row recipe is now in the reference. |
> | **TR-031** | Confirmed, and your diagnosis was exactly right — the label sits in `div.flex`, where `text-align` moves nothing. | **`DataTableColumn.Align`** (`Start`/`Center`/`End`) reaches the `th`, the label's flex box and the cells together. `HeaderClass="text-right"` alone is still read as the same intent, so your existing markup works unchanged. |
> | **TR-032** | **The root cause is not `NativeSelect`.** Your "the class merge appears to drop `bg-[url(…)]`, unconfirmed" was right, and here is the confirmation: `TailwindMerge.IsValidClassName` rejected **any** class containing `url(` as an injection guard, so `cn()` silently deleted the library's own chevron. | Arbitrary values (inside `[…]`) are now validated against their own charset; only executable payloads are rejected. **This was eating your classes too** — any `bg-[url(…)]` you passed anywhere vanished the same way. |
> | **TR-033** | Confirmed. `ShowToolbar` was all-or-nothing and exposed no filter state. | **`@bind-SearchText`** — the same state the built-in box drives, so you can host the input in the card header and still get the grid's real filtering over `Filterable` columns — plus **`ShowColumnChooser`** to drop the `Columns` button on its own. Measured: 3 rows → 1 from a card-header input, no toolbar rendered. |
> | **TR-034** | Confirmed, and `<span>` was the right call. | **`Badge.As`**, defaulting to **`"span"`**. Still `inline-flex`, so nothing looks different — your six permanent `mockup-parity` findings on `/effort` should now key correctly. `As="div"` is the escape hatch. |
> | **TR-035** | Confirmed exactly as filed: `--sidebar-width-mobile` was declared at 18rem and read by **zero** elements. | The phone sheet reads it. Measured at 390px: **288px**, was 256px. Also **`SidebarProvider.Width` / `.MobileWidth` / `.IconWidth`** if you want per-shell control. **Drop your `:root { --sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-mobile) }` media-query rule** or it will now compound. |
>
> **Read the CHANGELOG's "Behaviour changes to review before upgrading" before you take this.** Five
> things change by design: `Badge` is a `<span>`, a long badge label no longer wraps unless asked,
> classes containing `url(` are no longer deleted (so classes that used to vanish now take effect),
> `text-left`/`text-center`/`text-right` no longer conflict with text *colour* in the merge, and the
> phone sidebar is 18rem.
>
> **Please re-test and reopen anything that still bites.**

> ## ✅ RESOLVED LIBRARY-SIDE 2026-08-31 — ships in the next release
>
> Triaged (`*triage-issues`) and fixed (`*fix-issues`) against current source under **REQ-UI-019**.
> Release build 0 warnings / 0 errors; **44/44** new headless-Chromium checks
> (`tests/verify/ui-tflens.spec.js`) with every existing suite still green — **166/166** executed
> checks in total. Evidence: `docs/TrBlazeUI-Checklist.md` REQ-UI-019, ledger `docs/.last-verify.json`.
>
> **First, the version gap — it accounts for a quarter of this file.** TfLens built against
> **2.0.0**; the library was already at **2.1.0** when this was filed. **Five entries were already
> fixed** and needed no library change at all:
>
> | Entry | Reported as | Reality on 2.1.0 |
> |---|---|---|
> | **TR-002** | "no responsive variants at all; 1 `@media` rule; 710 utilities" | **21** `@media` rules, **4,934** escaped responsive selectors, ~10,477 class selectors. `.trblazeui-col-md-6` really does sit inside `@media (min-width:48rem)`. |
> | **TR-003** | `PasswordStrength`/`CenteredPanel`/`StatTile`/`StatGroup`/`CodeBlock` absent | All present **and documented**. |
> | **TR-013** | `Typography*` drops unmatched attributes | All 11 splat `CaptureUnmatchedValues`. |
> | **TR-020** | `SelectValue` shows the raw key until the popover opens | `SelectContent` instantiates items while closed; `DisplayTextSelector` also exists. |
> | **TR-023** | `BreadcrumbLink` throws on `data-testid` | Splats on both render branches. |
>
> **The action for those five is to upgrade and delete the workarounds** — in particular the
> hand-written media queries in `AuthLayout.razor.css` / `Profile.razor.css`, and
> `PasswordStrengthMeter.razor`.
>
> **Everything else is now fixed.** Highlights, with the root cause where it differed from the
> filed diagnosis:
>
> - **TR-009** — confirmed exactly as filed and it was live in this library's *own* demo (500 records
>   with `ShowPagination="false"` rendering 5 rows). `ShowPagination` was a *chrome* flag; it now gates
>   the data. ⚠ **Breaking:** a grid you turned pagination off over will now paint every row.
> - **TR-008** — your merged TR-022 root cause was **exactly right**. `lucide.json` ships 212 aliases;
>   the *code generator* only ever read the `icons` map, so the C# had nothing to fall back to. Fixed at
>   the generator. One correction: a question glyph **does** exist (`circle-help` → `circle-question-mark`),
>   so the `list-checks` substitution is unnecessary. (`content/lucide.json` **is** in the nupkg and always
>   was — an intermediate triage note claiming otherwise was wrong and has been retracted, so your
>   name-lookup escape hatch works today.)
> - **TR-014** — your diagnosis ("AlertDialog is not built on `Primitives.Dialog`") was **not** the cause:
>   it is built on the primitive. `AlertDialogContent` pinned `CloseOnEscape="false"` as a literal with no
>   parameter to override, and `Dialog.Modal` was a parameter **nothing read** while the reference
>   documented it. Both fixed. Your second observation — Escape dying after a re-render — was correct and
>   subtle: Escape was an *element* handler, and a document-level helper had shipped with zero call sites.
> - **TR-011a** — the ApexCharts runtime **is** loaded (that part was wrong), and there is **no reflection
>   inference** — so the property-order projection workaround was cargo-culting a mechanism that does not
>   exist. `ChartBase.Items` was simply a parameter nothing read. It is now wired, and real `XValue`/`YValue`
>   were added — which also closes **TR-005**'s original ask.
> - **TR-018 / TR-019 / TR-016 / TR-012 / TR-024 / TR-025 / TR-027** — all fixed; see the CHANGELOG.
> - **TR-011b, TR-015, TR-026, TR-017, TR-004** were **documentation** defects, and the reference was the
>   single largest source of your build problems. §1's imports block was missing **30** namespaces
>   (including `Empty`); `DataTableColumn`, `DialogContent` and `AlertDialogContent` had no parameter
>   tables at all; the icon guidance forbade an API that works. All corrected.
> - **TR-001 / TR-021** were mostly closed in 2.1.0; the residual is fixed — `--font-sans`/`--font-mono`
>   were referenced by the base reset and never defined, and the `p-*`/`m-*`/`gap-*`/`size-*`/`space-*`
>   safelist stopped short of the scale `w-*`/`h-*` already covered. **Arbitrary values (`p-[3px]`,
>   `h-[34px]`) remain structurally unavailable** in a pre-built stylesheet — that constraint is real and
>   is now stated in the reference rather than left to be discovered.
>
> **Please re-test against the next published release and reopen anything that still bites.** Read the CHANGELOG's
> "Behaviour changes to review before upgrading" first — several fixes change behaviour by design.

Gaps found while building TfLens against **TrBlazeUI.Components 2.0.0** / **TrBlazeUI.Icons.Lucide 2.0.0**.
Each entry is a real blocker or defect met during the build, with the workaround that shipped so the
build never stopped for a library issue.

> **Numbering reconciled 2026-08-27.** Concurrent build clusters had independently allocated the same
> TR numbers four times (`TR-010`, `TR-011`, `TR-012`, `TR-014` each appeared twice). The **first**
> occurrence of each kept its number — those are the ones cited from the checklist and the DevGuide —
> and the four later duplicates were renumbered to `TR-015`…`TR-018`. All entries were then unique and
> every citation elsewhere in `docs/` resolved. `TR-006` and `TR-007` were never allocated and are
> deliberately left free. **Allocating a number: take the next free one, and never renumber an existing
> entry.**
>
> **Updated 2026-08-28 (handoff consolidation).** `TR-019`…`TR-022` were added by the Phase 3 build, and
> `TR-022` turned out to duplicate `TR-008` (both are `LucideIcon` failing to resolve `lucide.json`
> aliases) — it was merged into `TR-008` and survives as a redirect stub, because other documents already
> cite it. **The highest allocated number is `TR-022`; the next free one is `TR-023`.** That leaves
> **19 substantive entries** across 20 headings. The three stale `TR-006` / `TR-007` comments that used
> to sit in `src/` were corrected the same day to the numbers they actually meant (`TR-009`, `TR-010`,
> `TR-013`), so no citation anywhere now points at an unallocated number.
>
> **Re-verified 2026-08-28.** `TR-019`…`TR-022` were added since. Every ID in the file is unique, every
> in-file cross-reference resolves (`TR-002` ← TR-019/TR-021 · `TR-010` ← TR-019 · `TR-008` ⇄ `TR-022`),
> and no number was reused. `TR-006` and `TR-007` remain unallocated — see *Known-stale citations* below
> for the three `src/` comments that still name them. **The next free number is `TR-023`.**
>
> **Allocated since (2026-08-30):** `TR-023` (BreadcrumbLink passthrough), `TR-024` (TabsList
> passthrough + no track density), `TR-025` (DataTable has no density option) and `TR-026`
> (`DataTableColumn` width / per-cell class parameters undocumented). **The next free number is
> `TR-028`.** `TR-027` (BreadcrumbList always wraps) was added 2026-08-30 by the harness fix.
>
> **Collision corrected 2026-08-30.** Two `*build-phase` sub-agents running in parallel both allocated
> `TR-024` — the `TabsList` entry and the `DataTableColumn` entry. `TR-024` was already registered above
> to `TabsList`, so it keeps the number; the `DataTableColumn` entry was renumbered to **`TR-026`**, and
> the one in-file citation of it (inside `TR-025`) was repointed with it. Every ID in the file is unique
> again. The lesson is recorded as a process note, not a library gap: concurrent writers to a
> single-counter file need the number assigned by the orchestrator, not chosen by the writer.

## Summary

36 entries: **0 blocking, 35 fixed upstream**, 1 closed (TR-022, merged into TR-008). **Nothing is
blocked.** TR-036, TR-037 and TR-038 were fixed library-side on 2026-09-13 (reply at the top of this
file) and wait only for a re-check here.

Two library replies cover all 32. The reply of **2026-08-31** answers 24 — TR-001 to TR-005, TR-008
to TR-021, TR-023 to TR-027. The reply of **2026-09-12**, at the top of this file, answers the eight
filed since: TR-028 to TR-035. Seven were fixed under REQ-UI-020; **TR-030 could not be reproduced**
— the `Class` parameter it asks for has existed since 2.1.0, and TfLens filed against 2.0.0.

> ## ⛏ THE UPGRADE HAPPENED — 2026-09-12
>
> **TfLens now builds against `2.1.0-ci.10`, not 2.0.0.** This section used to say "TfLens still
> builds against 2.0.0, so all 32 are re-checked after the upgrade, not before." That sentence was
> true when written and is now the history.
>
> **Why it stayed true so long is worth recording, because it was nobody's oversight in the code.**
> The fixed release is **not on nuget.org** — nuget.org stops at `2.0.3` — and TfLens had **no
> `nuget.config`**, so nothing in the repository pointed at the private GitHub Packages feed where
> `2.1.0-ci.10` lives. The upgrade was unreachable rather than undone. Fixed by adding
> `nuget.config` at the repository root (no credentials in it; the token belongs in the user-level
> config) and moving both `PackageReference` versions in `src/TfLens/TfLens.csproj`.
>
> **The version numbers in the two replies do not match the feed.** The replies speak of "2.1.0";
> the feed's stable line is 2.0.x and the fixes ship on the `2.1.0-ci.*` prereleases. `2.0.3` carries
> the 2026-08-31 batch (TR-001 … TR-027, including the `CollapsibleTrigger.Class` that made TR-030
> unreproducible); only `2.1.0-ci.10` carries the 2026-09-12 batch (TR-028 … TR-035). Verified
> against the shipped `TrBlazeUI.Components.xml`, not taken from the replies.
>
> **Two entries this file recorded as still-open gaps are in fact fixed**, and were nearly left in
> place on the strength of that: **TR-025** (`DataTable.Density`, `Comfortable` | `Compact`) and
> **TR-027** (`Breadcrumb.Wrap`, `Breadcrumb.ListClass`). Both parameters exist and both cite their
> TR number in their own doc comments. Their entries below are corrected.

Close each entry with `bash .tfcore/utils/tf-feedback.sh TfLens --close <ID> "<what you ran and what
it showed>"`; a bare `tf-feedback.sh TfLens` prints every entry's state. Never describe a fixed entry
as an open problem.

**Every workaround in TR-028 to TR-035 can be removed on upgrade**, and the `--sidebar-width`
media-query override for TR-035 **must** go or it will compound with the library's own fix.

This file is the one log of library gaps for every phase; a gap met on any phase's screen is filed
here as a new entry.

#### Detail

What the last eight entries affected, as filed:

| Entry | What it affects | Blocks or breaks anything? |
|---|---|---|
| **TR-028** — the bar chart has no axis, grid or value-label settings | The token chart on the Harness page. TfLens draws it with the chart component underneath, which does take settings. | No. The chart matches its design. |
| **TR-029** — a long badge label spills out of its pill on a phone | The stream-health card on the Misses page. The label was shortened and the sentence moved into the card's text. | No. |
| **TR-030** — the button that opens a collapsible row does not fill the row | The per-phase rows on the Phase effort page. One style rule widens the button. | No. |
| **TR-031** — a table column's header cannot be right-aligned over its figures | The rate tables on the Price providers page. One style rule moves the header label right. | No. |
| **TR-032** — the native select shows no arrow | The Provider list in "Add or change a rate" on the Price providers page. One style rule gives the browser's own arrow back. | No. |
| **TR-033** — a data grid's search box can only sit in the grid's own toolbar | The per-miss table on the Misses page. The filter works; it sits above the table instead of in the card header, where the design draws it. | No. |
| **TR-034** — a pill is always a block element, so it cannot sit inside a sentence | The count pills on the Phase effort page. They render and read correctly; a design gate cannot pair them with the mockup's. | No. |
| **TR-035** — the phone menu ignores the mobile width the library itself defines | The slid-out menu on every screen below 768px. One rule in the app's stylesheet restores the designed 18rem. | No. |

**Answered 2026-09-12** — the request below was sent and has been worked. See the reply at the top
of this file for what changed and what to review before upgrading. It is kept here as the record of
what was asked.

```
Fix the TrBlazeUI problems TfLens filed after your reply of 2026-08-31. Work from
docs/TfLens-TrBlazeUI-Feedback.md in the TfLens repo: entries TR-028, TR-029,
TR-030, TR-031, TR-032, TR-033, TR-034 and TR-035. Each names the component, what TfLens saw, the
workaround it shipped and a suggested fix.
```

- **Corrected 2026-09-11.** This Summary used to say "all 28 open. None is fixed upstream". It was
  written on 2026-09-02, after the reply at the top of the file, and never took the reply in. It now
  follows the entries.
- `TR-006` and `TR-007` were never allocated; `TR-022` is the merge stub into `TR-008`.

**Severity words used in the entries map to those counts as:** `High` = blocker · `Medium` = major ·
`Low` = minor. Nothing in this file is filed nice-to-have. The entry bodies keep their original
`High`/`Medium`/`Low` wording — the mapping is stated here rather than applied to them, so no entry's
recorded severity was silently reinterpreted.

| Band | Count | Entries | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Blocker** (High) | 6 | TR-001 · TR-002 · TR-009 · TR-011 · TR-021 · TR-028 | all six fixed upstream |
| **Major** (Medium) | 12 | TR-003 · TR-005 · TR-008 · TR-010 · TR-014 · TR-018 · TR-019 · TR-020 · TR-023 · TR-024 · TR-026 · TR-029 | all twelve fixed upstream |
| **Minor** (Low) | 14 | TR-004 · TR-012 · TR-013 · TR-015 · TR-016 · TR-017 · TR-025 · TR-027 · TR-030 · TR-031 · TR-032 · TR-033 · TR-034 · TR-035 | all fourteen fixed upstream (TR-030 was already fixed in 2.1.0 — upgrade, no library change) |
| Nice-to-have | 0 | — | — |

The table used to list 19 entries; TR-023 to TR-030 had been added since it was last rebuilt. With
TR-022 closed as a merge, the 27 rows here and that one make the 28. TR-031 was added on 2026-09-11,
which makes 29, TR-032 the same day, which makes 30, TR-033 the same day, which makes 31, and TR-034
and TR-035 the same day — the fix-cycle-1 side-by-side comparisons — which makes 33. `TR-036`, `TR-037` and
`TR-038` were added on 2026-09-12 by the upgrade pass, which makes 36. **The next free number is
`TR-039`.**

Entries below are ordered **blocker → major → minor**, and by ID within a band. **IDs are unchanged** —
the order is a reading aid, never a renumbering.

### What changed in the 2026-08-28 consolidation

1. **`TR-022` merged into `TR-008`.** Same repro, same expected, same actual — one defect filed twice,
   the second time without re-reading the first. The lower ID keeps the entry; `TR-022` remains as a
   stub at the foot of the file so the citations in `docs/TfLens-DevGuide-Screens.md` and
   `PROJECT-STATUS.md` still resolve. TR-022's root-cause finding (the unread `aliases` map in
   `lucide.json`) is carried into TR-008 in full — it is the better half of the merge. **This is why
   the file holds 19 entries, not 20.**
2. **`TR-021` raised Medium → High.** A silent zero-width render with no error and no console warning
   is the same failure class this file already grades High in TR-009 and TR-011(a), and it defeats the
   usual visibility checks besides. The reason is written into the entry itself.
3. **No entry was renumbered, and no entry was deleted.**

### Known-stale citations elsewhere (not fixable from this file)

`TR-006` and `TR-007` were **never allocated** here, but three source comments still cite them, having
been written before the 2026-08-27 renumbering:

| Citation | Cites | Actually means |
|---|---|---|
| `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Harness.razor:99` | `TR-006` | **TR-009** (`ShowPagination="false"` still truncates to `InitialPageSize`) |
| `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/GateOutcomes.razor:92` | `TR-006` | **TR-010** (`TabsTrigger` captures no unmatched attributes) |
| `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/GateOutcomes.razor:22` | `TR-007` | **TR-013** (the `Typography*` family) |

Left as-is deliberately: they are `src/` comments and this pass is documentation-only. Recorded here so
the next reader is not sent looking for two entries that do not exist. `docs/TfLens-DevGuide-Screens.md`
already lists its own `TR-007` mention under "stale comments to ignore".

## TR-001 — The shipped stylesheet references design tokens it never defines (Alert has no colour, `bg-sidebar` is transparent)

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The shipped trblazeui.css now defines every token this entry listed - verified in the stylesheet: --alert-success/-bg, --alert-danger/-bg, --alert-info, --alert-warning, --sidebar and family, --font-sans, --font-mono. Deleted the local re-declarations from AuthLayout, Profile, StatTile, app.css and the Effort/Export/Harness/Misses/Prices/Routing/GateOutcomes scoped sheets. Measured: a failed sign-in Alert Variant=Danger computes bg oklch(0.27 0.06 22.216), text oklch(0.985 0 0), border oklab(0.637 0.19 0.09 / 0.3) - red tint, red border; bg-sidebar paints oklch(0.169 0 0) on both the brand panel and the app sidebar, where it had been falling back to --muted, so this is a parity gain.

- **Severity:** High — every `Alert` variant renders colourless, and the whole sidebar/auth brand surface renders transparent.
- **Repro:** Install `TrBlazeUI.Components` 2.0.0, link `_content/TrBlazeUI.Components/trblazeui.css`, render
  `<Alert Variant="AlertVariant.Danger"><AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle></Alert>` or any element with `class="bg-sidebar"`.
- **Expected:** The danger alert has a red tint, a red left accent and a red icon; `bg-sidebar` paints the sidebar surface.
- **Actual:** `trblazeui.css` emits `.bg-alert-danger-bg{background-color:var(--alert-danger-bg)}`,
  `.border-l-alert-danger{border-left-color:var(--alert-danger)}`, `.bg-sidebar{background-color:var(--sidebar)}` …
  but **defines none of those custom properties anywhere** in the package. The full undefined set is:
  `--alert-success`, `--alert-success-bg`, `--alert-info`, `--alert-info-bg`, `--alert-warning`,
  `--alert-warning-bg`, `--alert-danger`, `--alert-danger-bg`, `--sidebar`, `--sidebar-foreground`,
  `--sidebar-border`, `--sidebar-accent`, `--sidebar-accent-foreground`, `--sidebar-ring`,
  `--font-sans`, `--font-mono`. The `:where(:root)` / `:where(.dark)` blocks define only the base
  shadcn tokens (`--background` … `--ring`, `--radius`).
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-001..005 (every auth screen's `Alert`, the auth brand panel's `bg-sidebar`).
- **Workaround:** declare the missing custom properties on the page/layout root in the component's own
  scoped stylesheet (`AuthLayout.razor.css`, `Profile.razor.css`). Custom properties inherit, so every
  TrBlazeUI control rendered inside picks them up. This is per-page, not app-wide — the sidebar shell
  will need the same treatment.
- **Suggested fix:** ship the `--alert-*` and `--sidebar*` token values in the same `:where(:root)` /
  `:where(.dark)` blocks that already carry `--background` and friends.

## TR-002 — The shipped stylesheet contains no responsive variants at all

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The stylesheet ships 21 media rules and real responsive variants - verified by parsing it: .trblazeui-col-6 is top level, .trblazeui-col-md-6 sits inside @media (min-width:48rem) and .trblazeui-col-lg-3 inside @media (min-width:64rem), with sm/md/lg/xl/2xl at 40/48/64/80/96rem. Replaced the hand-written media queries with md:/lg: utilities across the auth layout, Profile, Harness, Coverage, GateOutcomes, Routing, Export, Misses, Effort and Prices. Measured: Misses KPI tiles 1 across at 390 and 4 at 1280; Profile page padding 32px at 1280 and 24px at 390. Arbitrary values (p-[3px], h-[34px], w-[45%]) are still absent from a pre-built sheet, so the rules needing one were kept and are commented as such.

- **Severity:** High — no breakpoint can be expressed in markup, so every responsive layout has to be hand-written CSS.
- **Repro:** Search `trblazeui.css` (2.0.0) for any `md:`, `sm:` or `lg:` escaped class. There are none;
  the file contains exactly one `@media` rule (a `prefers-color-scheme`-independent one for the chart tooltip)
  and 710 utility classes total — only those the library itself uses.
- **Expected:** Tailwind's standard responsive variants (`md:grid-cols-2`, `md:flex-row`, `sm:p-8`, …) are usable
  from the `Class` parameter, as every TrBlazeUI example and the AI reference's own snippets assume.
- **Actual:** `md:grid-cols-2` etc. are absent, so `Class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2"` renders a single column at
  every width. `grid-cols-2` itself is also absent (only `grid-cols-3` and `grid-cols-4` shipped).
  `.trblazeui-col-md-6` exists but is **not** wrapped in a media query — it is byte-identical to `.trblazeui-col-6`,
  so the "responsive" grid helper is not responsive either.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-001..004 (auth split layout), REQ-UI-005 (two profile cards stacking under `md`).
- **Workaround:** hand-written media queries in Blazor scoped stylesheets (`AuthLayout.razor.css`, `Profile.razor.css`).
- **Suggested fix:** either ship the full Tailwind utility surface, or document that consumers must run their
  own Tailwind build over their markup — and put the `trblazeui-col-{sm,md,lg,xl}-*` helpers inside real media queries.

## TR-009 — `DataTable ShowPagination="false"` still truncates the grid to `InitialPageSize`

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. ShowPagination=false renders every row now, so the inflated InitialPageSize values that existed only to stop the truncation were deleted along with their comments - AddSource, Coverage x4, Effort x5, GateOutcomes, Harness, Misses x4, Prices, Routing, ExportSurface, PlaybookCoverageSurface, PlaybookEffortSurface x4, PlaybookModelTokens, PlaybookPhaseTotals. Measured on the screen this entry was filed from: the gate-catch distribution on /gate-outcomes renders 10 of 10 rows at 1280 and 390 in the reference's gate order with escaped present and carrying its no-gate-caught-it badge - escaped being the one row the requirement exists for. Also 33 key/value rows on Harness, 25 stream rows on Coverage, 7 failed-practice rows on Misses, 15 phase rows on Effort. Real page sizes were kept where a pager is wanted.

- **Severity:** High — the table silently drops rows with no pager, no count and no warning; the page looks complete.
- **Repro:** `<DataTable TData="GateRow" Data="@eightRows" ShowToolbar="false" ShowPagination="false">` with eight rows.
- **Expected:** turning pagination off renders every row — that is the only reason to turn it off. The AI
  reference describes `ShowPagination` as "Allow pagination; the bar auto-hides when all rows fit one page",
  which reads as "no pager, all rows".
- **Actual:** only the first `InitialPageSize` rows render (default **5**). With `ShowPagination="false"` there is
  no pager to reveal the rest, so rows six onwards are simply absent from the DOM. On `/gate-outcomes` this
  silently cut the `standards`, **`escaped`** and `unattributed` rows off the gate-catch distribution — the
  `escaped` row is the one row the requirement exists for.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-020 (`gate-dist-{type}`, eight fixed rows in the reference's gate order).
- **Workaround:** set `InitialPageSize` above the row count (`InitialPageSize="32"`) whenever pagination is off.
- **Suggested fix:** when `ShowPagination` is `false`, ignore `InitialPageSize` and render the whole `Data`
  sequence; or document loudly that `InitialPageSize` still applies.

## TR-011 — `BarChart` renders an empty `<div>` (the ApexCharts runtime is never loaded), and a portalled `DialogContent` cannot be sized by the consumer

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. Both halves are closed. (a) The chart renders: ChartBase.Items is wired and the ApexCharts runtime loads, measured on /harness as 3 bars with value labels 12.1B, 1.6M and 37.1M, and on /routing as 5 bars with labels. The CSS bar row that stood in for a chart in PlaybookModelTokens is now a real BarChart. (b) The dialog can be sized: DialogContent is a flex column capped at the viewport with a scrolling body and shrink-0 header and footer; measured at 900px viewport the Add-source dialog is 768x868 and inside the viewport, and at 390x812 the Import button is reachable and passes a real Playwright actionability trial.

Two defects met on the same screen; both make a control unusable as shipped.

**(a) The chart renders nothing.**

- **Severity:** High — the component produces a blank box, with no error, no console warning and no fallback.
- **Repro:** `<ChartContainer><BarChart TItem="Point" Items="@points" Height="240" /></ChartContainer>` in a
  stock Blazor Server app that references `TrBlazeUI.Components` 2.0.0 and links `trblazeui.css`.
- **Expected:** bars.
- **Actual:** the rendered DOM is `<div class="w-full" data-slot="bar-chart"><div id="0e17…"></div></div>` —
  the mount point is created and never filled. `Blazor-ApexCharts` is a package dependency, but no
  `apexcharts` script or JS module is loaded (the package's own `staticwebassets/js/` ships twelve interop
  files and none of them is a chart), and nothing in the component or the docs tells a consumer to add one.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-028 (tokens-by-model totals).
- **Workaround:** the totals are drawn as a small CSS bar row in the page's scoped stylesheet, each bar
  labelled with the exact figure the table beside it states.
- **Suggested fix:** load the ApexCharts asset from the component (or document the required script tag), and
  make an unrenderable chart show its data as a table rather than an empty box.

**(b) A dialog cannot be widened.**

- **Severity:** Medium.
- **Repro:** `<DialogContent Class="my-wide-dialog">` with `.my-wide-dialog { max-width: 44rem }` in the
  calling page's scoped stylesheet, with or without `::deep`.
- **Expected:** the dialog is 44rem wide.
- **Actual:** it stays at `max-w-lg` (512px). `DialogContent` is rendered into `div.trblazeui-portal`
  directly under `<body>`, outside the calling component's subtree, so a Blazor scoped stylesheet can never
  match it — `::deep` included, since that still requires an ancestor inside the component. The only
  escape hatches the shipped CSS offers are `max-w-sm` / `max-w-md` / `max-w-lg` / `max-w-none`, and
  `max-w-none` with the component's own `w-full` means edge-to-edge.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-030 (a five-column rate-card table in a 512px dialog).
- **Workaround:** size the cells instead (`w-16 text-right` on each `Input`) and keep the table in an
  `overflow-x-auto` box.
- **Suggested fix:** ship a `Size`/`MaxWidth` parameter on `DialogContent`, or a documented CSS custom
  property the portal honours.

## TR-021 — The shipped stylesheet's spacing/sizing scale has holes (`w-20`, `mt-3`, `my-4` are absent), so a control sized with one silently collapses to zero

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The base scale is complete - verified .w-20, .mt-3, .my-4, .max-h-* and .gap-x-* are all emitted by the shipped stylesheet. The substituted steps were replaced with what the design asks for: the failed-practice share bars on /misses moved from w-16 back to w-20 and the class is live on the rendered Progress. This was the highest-value entry in the file because the hole was unbounded; the scale it names is now present.

- **Severity:** High — **raised from Medium on 2026-08-28 consolidation.** A component given
  `Class="w-20"` renders with **zero width**: no error, no warning, no console message, and a control
  that looks deliberately hidden rather than broken. That is the same failure class this file already
  grades High elsewhere — TR-009 (rows silently dropped, "the page looks complete") and TR-011(a) (an
  empty chart box, "no error, no console warning and no fallback") — and this one is worse than both,
  because the collapsed control still passes every "is it visible?" test. Filed Medium when it was
  written; nothing about the evidence supported that, so it is corrected here rather than left
  inconsistent with its own neighbours. **This is the highest-value entry in the file:** the whole
  utility surface is generated from the library's own internal usage, so the hole is unbounded and
  every consumer meets it eventually, on a different class each time.
- **Repro:** `<Progress Value="24" Class="w-20" />` in an app that links only
  `_content/TrBlazeUI.Components/trblazeui.css`. Then measure:
  `document.querySelector('[role="progressbar"]').getBoundingClientRect().width`.
- **Expected:** 5rem. The class is part of the Tailwind scale the library's own markup and its AI
  reference use, and the neighbouring steps (`w-16`, `w-40`) are present.
- **Actual:** `0`. `trblazeui.css` emits `.w-2 .w-3 .w-4 … .w-14 .w-16 .w-40 .w-64 .w-72` and stops — the
  file carries only the utilities the library's own components happen to use, so the scale reads as
  complete while several steps are missing. The same is true of `mt-3` and `my-4` (both `mt-2` and `mt-4`
  exist, so the gap is invisible until a build lands on the wrong step). This is the sibling of TR-002:
  there the responsive variants were byte-identical no-ops, here the base utilities are simply absent.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-037 — the failed-practice share bars on `/misses` (`miss-whymissed`), which
  rendered as a zero-width `Progress` beside a correct percentage; and the `Separator`s in the cost band.
- **Workaround:** use a step the file actually ships (`w-16` here) or declare the rule in the page's own
  scoped CSS. Before shipping a screen, grep the class names used against `trblazeui.css` — a class the
  file does not define fails silently and geometry gates only catch it when the collapse causes an overlap.
- **Suggested fix:** ship the full base scale for the utilities the components and the AI reference name,
  or document exactly which subset is supported so a consumer knows when to write their own rule.

## TR-003 — `PasswordStrength`, `CenteredPanel`, `StatTile` / `StatGroup` and `CodeBlock` do not exist in 2.0.0

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. PasswordStrengthMeter.razor is replaced by the shipped PasswordStrength - measured rendering 4 segments (3 filled, 1 muted) over a caption, which is the mockup's .pws shape; the local shim was a single Progress bar the mockup never drew. StatTile, StatGroup, CenteredPanel and CodeBlock are all present in the package and were assessed against their mockups: the local StatTile and CodeBlock are KEPT deliberately because the shipped ones lack features the design needs (the KPI chip, sparkline, provenance adornment and column span; an icon-only copy button and a title slot), and CenteredPanel does not match a 100vh flex row holding a 400px panel. Recorded rather than forced - a deletion is not worth regressing a screen.

- **Severity:** Medium — the components the design spec was written against are not in the shipped package.
- **Repro:** `TrBlazeUI.Components` 2.0.0 `lib/net10.0/TrBlazeUI.Components.dll` contains no
  `TrBlazeUI.Components.PasswordStrength`, `…CenteredPanel`, `…Stat`, or `…CodeBlock` namespace or type.
  The package's own `docs/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` does not document them either.
- **Expected:** `docs/TfLens-UIDesign.md` §Library gaps records these as present in the GitHub repo at mockup time
  and mandates their use.
- **Actual:** absent from the NuGet package the project consumes.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-002 / REQ-UI-004 / REQ-UI-005 (`PasswordStrength`), REQ-UI-001..004 (`CenteredPanel`).
- **Workaround:** `PasswordStrengthMeter.razor` composes the meter from the library's own `Progress`
  (the fallback §Library gaps itself names); the auth card is centred by the layout's own flexbox instead of
  `CenteredPanel`.
- **Suggested fix:** publish a NuGet build that carries the components already in the repo, or correct the
  reference doc to match what 2.0.0 actually ships.

## TR-005 — The chart components have no `XValue` / `YValue`; the AI reference documents an API that does not exist

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-12** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10; XValue/YValue are real parameters and ChartBase.Items is wired. Deleted the HarnessTokenTotal property-order projection and its siblings - there was never any reflection inference, so that workaround was cargo-culting a mechanism that did not exist. Charts now read their domain types through explicit accessors. Measured 2026-09-12 on /harness: 3 bars from HarnessTokens directly, correct categories and values. The separate shorthand data-label defect found while doing this is filed as TR-037, not left inside this entry. Every charted value still has its text twin, which UIDesign requires independently.

> **FIXED upstream — taken up 2026-09-12.** `XValue` and `YValue` are real parameters on
> `ChartBase<TItem>` and `ChartBase.Items` is wired (it had been a parameter nothing read). The
> "shape a projection type whose property order matches what the reflection expects" workaround
> below was **cargo-culting a mechanism that never existed** — there is no reflection inference in
> the component at all, which the 2026-08-31 reply says in as many words. `HarnessTokenTotal` and
> its sibling projections are deleted; the charts read their domain types directly through explicit
> accessors.
>
> ⚠ **But the shorthand this entry asked for cannot draw data labels** — see **[TR-037](#tr-037)**,
> filed 2026-09-12 while taking this fix up. `Items`/`XValue`/`YValue` with `ShowDataLabels="true"`
> silently produces a chart with no labels, and the reference's own example demonstrates that exact
> combination. The nested `ApexPointSeries` form is the one that works.
>
> The requirement below that every charted value also appear as text beside the chart **stands
> unchanged** — `docs/TfLens-UIDesign.md` §Library gaps requires it for its own reasons, not as a
> workaround for this entry, and it is still honoured on every chart.

- **Severity:** Medium — every documented chart snippet fails to compile.
- **Repro:** `<BarChart TItem="Point" Items="@points" XValue="@(p => p.Label)" YValue="@(p => p.Total)" />`,
  copied verbatim from `TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` §"Chart (ApexCharts wrapper)".
- **Expected:** compiles, per the reference.
- **Actual:** `error CS8917: The delegate type could not be inferred` — `BarChart<TItem>` (and every other
  chart type, all deriving from `ChartBase<TItem>`) exposes only
  `Items`, `Config` (`ChartConfig` → `ChartSeriesConfig { Label, Color }`), `Height`, `Width`, `Class`,
  `ShowLegend`, `LegendPosition`, `ShowDataLabels`, `ShowTooltip`, `Title`, `EnableAnimations`, plus the
  per-type `Variant`. Categories and series are inferred from `TItem`'s properties by reflection; there is
  no accessor pair at all, so a caller cannot say which property is the category and which is the value.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-028 (tokens-by-model totals chart).
- **Workaround:** shape a purpose-built projection type whose property order matches what the reflection
  expects (`record ModelTotal(string Model, double Total)`) and pass only `Items`. Because the mapping is
  implicit and undocumented, TfLens also renders every charted value as text in the table beside the chart —
  which `docs/TfLens-UIDesign.md` §Library gaps already requires for a different reason.
- **Suggested fix:** add `XValue` / `YValue` (or a `ChartSeries` child component) as the reference already
  claims, or correct the reference to document the reflection contract and its ordering rules.

## TR-008 — `TrBlazeUI.Icons.Lucide` 2.0.0 does not resolve the pre-rename Lucide names, so every `*-circle` / `alert-*` name renders nothing

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. LucideIcon resolves the aliases map now - verified in the package's own content/lucide.json that alert-triangle resolves to triangle-alert, check-circle to circle-check-big and help-circle/circle-help to circle-question-mark. Measured across six screen-states at 1280 and 390 on gate-outcomes, routing and export: 0 data-trblazeui-missing-icon placeholders and 0 empty lucide svg elements. Note the aliases are not always synonyms - check-circle resolves to circle-check-big, a different glyph from circle-check, and the mockup draws the big one, so the name matters and was chosen per design rather than normalised.

> **Merged 2026-08-28.** `TR-022` was filed on 2026-08-28 as a separate entry (*"`LucideIcon` does not
> resolve the aliases in its own `lucide.json`"*) before this entry was re-read. It carries the **same
> repro** (`<LucideIcon Name="check-circle" Size="16" />`), the **same expected** (the circled check
> renders) and the **same actual** (nothing renders), so it is the same defect, not a second one — and
> `docs/TfLens-DevGuide-Screens.md:203` says as much: *"Confirmed again 2026-08-28 as `TR-022`"*.
> Per this file's numbering rule the lower ID wins, so the two are merged here under **TR-008** and
> `TR-022` is kept as a stub that points at this entry, because `docs/TfLens-DevGuide-Screens.md` and
> `PROJECT-STATUS.md` already cite it. **TR-022's contribution is kept and it is the valuable part:** it
> supplies the root cause this entry originally guessed at. The severity is TR-008's Medium (the higher
> of the two); TR-022 had been filed Low.

- **Severity:** Medium — the icon silently disappears; there is no build error and no runtime error, only a
  `data-trblazeui-missing-icon` placeholder that occupies the right box and draws nothing.
- **Repro:** `<LucideIcon Name="check-circle" Size="16" />`, `<LucideIcon Name="alert-triangle" Size="16" />`,
  `<LucideIcon Name="help-circle" Size="16" />`, `<LucideIcon Name="x-circle" Size="16" />`.
- **Expected:** the icons render. These are the names the package's own `TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` uses
  (`<Alert Variant="AlertVariant.Danger"><LucideIcon Name="alert-circle" …>`), and the names
  `docs/TfLens-UIDesign.md` and every mockup were written against. They are also real Lucide names that
  are **present in the package's own `content/lucide.json`**, under `aliases`.
- **Actual:** nothing renders for any pre-rename spelling. Probed on the running app,
  `circle-check`, `circle-alert`, `triangle-alert`, `circle-x`, `badge-check`, `x`, `clock`, `percent`,
  `target`, `shield-check`, `ban`, `bug`, `list-checks`, `gauge`, `trending-up`, `trending-down`, `flag`,
  `zap`, `chart-bar` and `bar-chart-3` all render; `check-circle`, `check-circle-2`, `alert-circle`,
  `alert-triangle`, `x-circle`, `help-circle` and `circle-help` all render nothing. There is no
  `circle-help` under either name, so a "question" glyph is simply unavailable.
  This is already visible in the shipped shell: the sidebar's **Gate outcomes** item (`shield-check`; `help-circle` when this was logged) has no
  icon at all, and `Repos.razor`'s rate-limit and private-repo alerts (`alert-triangle`) have none either.
- **Root cause (from the merged TR-022, 2026-08-28):** the names are **not missing from the package** —
  this entry's original reading ("2.0.0 carries only the post-rename names") was one layer short.
  `lucide.json` ships two maps, `icons` and `aliases`, and the aliased spellings are all present in
  `aliases`. The component looks the name up in **`icons` only**, so every aliased spelling
  (`check-circle` → `circle-check`, and the rest of Lucide's renamed set) resolves to nothing. There is
  no warning and no fallback glyph, which is why a blank icon is indistinguishable from a deliberate one.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-018 (the three KPI tiles' icons and the empty state's icon on
  `/gate-outcomes`); and, as TR-022, REQ-UI-036 — the measured-USD tile's accent chip on `/misses`
  rendered as an empty coloured square.
- **Workaround:** use the canonical name from the `icons` map — `circle-check`, `triangle-alert`, `x` —
  and substitute `list-checks` where no question glyph exists. A quick check against
  `~/.nuget/packages/trblazeui.icons.lucide/<version>/content/lucide.json` settles any name.
- **Suggested fix:** **fall back to the `aliases` map on a miss in `icons`** — the data is already in the
  package, only the lookup is one map short, so this is a small change that fixes every aliased name at
  once. Failing that, ship the pre-rename aliases into `icons` directly. Either way, emit a build-time or
  development-time warning naming the closest match for a name that resolves in neither map, and update
  `TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` to the names the package actually carries.

## TR-010 — `TabsTrigger` / `TabsContent` / `TabsList` capture no unmatched attributes, so a tab cannot carry a test id

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent, DialogHeader and DialogFooter capture unmatched values now, so the span wrappers carrying the test ids were deleted and each id MOVED onto the component itself. Measured on the screen this entry was filed from: exactly one element matches each routing-tab-{key} on /routing, each a BUTTON with role=tab, and each click activates its panel, at 1280 and 390. Same treatment on gate-outcomes type-tab-*, the Playbook routing and questions surfaces, AddSource and Coverage. Ids were moved, never duplicated - two matches would be a different failure.

- **Severity:** Medium — it makes the tab controls unaddressable from any test or analytics attribute, and it
  fails at **runtime**, not at compile time.
- **Repro:** `<TabsTrigger Value="drift" data-testid="routing-tab-drift">Routing drift</TabsTrigger>`.
- **Expected:** the attribute lands on the rendered trigger, as it does on `Tabs`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Button`,
  `Alert`, `DataTable`, `Empty` and every other component in the library.
- **Actual:** `System.InvalidOperationException: Object of type 'TrBlazeUI.Components.Tabs.TabsTrigger' does not
  have a property matching the name 'data-testid'` — a 500 on the page, with nothing at build time to warn you.
  `TabsTrigger` exposes only `Value`, `Disabled`, `ChildContent`, `Class`; `TabsList` and `TabsContent` only
  `ChildContent`/`Class` (+`Value`/`ForceMount`). `Dialog`, `DialogHeader` and `DialogFooter` have the same gap.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-027 (the `routing-tab-{key}` ids the acceptance asserts literally).
- **Workaround:** put the id on a `<span>` inside the trigger's `ChildContent` — a click on the span still
  activates the trigger, and the id is where a test can find it.
- **Suggested fix:** add `[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)] Dictionary<string, object>? AdditionalAttributes`
  to `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent`, `DialogHeader` and `DialogFooter`, and splat it, as the rest of
  the library already does.

## TR-014 — `AlertDialog` has no Escape handling at all, and no `CloseOnEscape` / `Modal` to turn it on

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. AlertDialog closes on Escape by default now. The workaround this entry describes - a capture-phase document keydown listener, a JSInvokable callback and an Escape-owning IAsyncDisposable - had ALREADY GONE on 2026-08-28 under REQ-UI-044, when Add-source and Remove stopped being dialogs and became routes, so 0 lines of JS interop were deleted here; what remained was four comments asserting the bug as present fact, and those are corrected. AddSource's surviving IJSObjectReference, DotNetObjectReference and DisposeAsync belong entirely to the file-upload interop and were left alone. Measured: Escape on /repos/remove leaves the routed confirmation intact with no stranded backdrop, and no page-level listener exists to remove.

- **Severity:** Medium — a confirmation dialog that cannot be dismissed with Escape fails a plain
  accessibility expectation, and there is no parameter to opt in.
- **Repro:** `<AlertDialog @bind-Open="objIsRemoveOpen"><AlertDialogContent>…<AlertDialogCancel>…</AlertDialogCancel>
  <AlertDialogAction>…</AlertDialogAction></AlertDialogContent></AlertDialog>`, open it, press **Escape**.
- **Expected:** Escape closes the alert dialog, the same way it closes `Dialog` and `Sheet` — the shadcn/ui
  AlertDialog this component mirrors closes on Escape by default, and the package's own `Dialog` documents
  `Modal` as "Dismiss on outside click/Escape".
- **Actual:** nothing happens; only the `AlertDialogCancel` button closes it. `TrBlazeUI.Components.AlertDialog.AlertDialog`
  exposes only `ChildContent` / `Open` / `OpenChanged` / `DefaultOpen` / `OnOpenChange`, and `AlertDialogContent`
  only `ChildContent` / `Class` / `AdditionalAttributes` — there is no `Modal`, no `CloseOnEscape`, no
  `OnEscapeKeyDown`. Unlike `Dialog`, `AlertDialog` is not built on `TrBlazeUI.Primitives.Dialog.DialogContent`
  (there is no `AlertDialog` type in `TrBlazeUI.Primitives` at all), so it never inherits that primitive's
  `CloseOnEscape` / `TrapFocus` / `LockScroll` behaviour. Passing `CloseOnEscape="true"` through
  `AdditionalAttributes` only emits a stray HTML attribute.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-013 (the remove-repo confirmation on `/repos`), whose acceptance names Escape.
- **Related, same page:** the Connect `Dialog` — which *does* have `CloseOnEscape` via the primitive — stopped
  honouring Escape once a validation result had re-rendered its content (REQ-UI-012's recorded observation).
  Both were cured by the same page-level listener below, which suggests the primitive's document `keydown`
  registration does not survive a content re-render.
- **Workaround:** own the key in the page. `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Repos.razor.js` adds one capture-phase
  `document` `keydown` listener and calls a `[JSInvokable]` method on the component, which sets the bound
  `Open` field to `false`; the listener ignores the press when an open `role="listbox"` popup (Select/Combobox)
  should consume it, and the page implements `IAsyncDisposable` to remove it. Costs an interop hop per Escape
  and has to be repeated on every page that uses `AlertDialog`.
- **Suggested fix:** build `AlertDialog` on the same `Primitives.Dialog` layer `Dialog` uses, or at minimum add
  `Modal` / `CloseOnEscape` / `OnEscapeKeyDown` to `AlertDialogContent` with `CloseOnEscape` defaulting to true;
  and re-register the primitive's Escape listener on re-render so a dialog whose body changes keeps its key
  handling.

## TR-018 — A closed `CollapsibleContent` keeps its children in normal flow, so the collapsed panel still occupies (and overlaps) the space below it

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. A closed CollapsibleContent carries hidden plus display:none now and contributes no layout box, so the @if guards that emptied the subtree were dropped from PlaybookObservedFields, Effort and Misses. Measured at 1280 and 390 on the screen this entry was filed from: open, the content box is 70px (1280) and 170px (390) with 0px overlap against pb-coverage-notes; closed, the content is STILL IN THE DOM - revealed rather than re-created - with hidden true and box height 0, and 0px overlap. The 45px overlap this entry recorded does not return.

- **Severity:** Medium — a collapsed disclosure silently lands on top of whatever follows it in the page,
  and the collision is invisible in a screenshot (the text is clipped) but real to every geometry-based
  layout gate, to hit-testing, and to a screen reader walking the accessibility tree.
- **Repro:** render a card whose body is
  `<Collapsible @bind-Open="objIsOpen"><CollapsibleTrigger>…</CollapsibleTrigger><CollapsibleContent><div data-testid="body">…tall content…</div></CollapsibleContent></Collapsible>`
  with `objIsOpen` **false**, and put a sibling element after the card. Then measure:
  `document.querySelector('[data-testid="body"]').getBoundingClientRect()`.
- **Expected:** a closed `CollapsibleContent` contributes no box — either its children are not rendered at
  all, or the subtree is `display:none` / `hidden` so nothing inside it reports a non-zero rect. That is
  what the shadcn/ui Collapsible this component mirrors does (Radix sets `hidden` on closed content).
- **Actual:** the children are rendered and laid out normally inside a zero-height, `overflow: hidden`
  wrapper. `overflow:hidden` clips the paint but does **not** clip layout, so the inner element still
  reports its full natural height — measured 45px of vertical overlap with the next sibling card on a
  1280px viewport. `getComputedStyle` reports neither `display:none` nor `visibility:hidden`, so the
  usual "is it visible?" tests all say yes.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-034 — `Components/Shared/Playbook/PlaybookObservedFields.razor`, the
  "Observed fields" disclosure on the Coverage page's Playbook state. The visual gate in
  `tests/verify/ui-playbook-state.spec.ts` failed with
  `playbook-observed-fields overlaps pb-coverage-notes by 958x45px @1280`.
- **Workaround:** guard the content in the component itself —
  `<CollapsibleContent>@if (objIsOpen) { <div …>…</div> }</CollapsibleContent>` — so the closed state has
  no subtree at all and therefore no phantom box. The disclosure also now opens by default, which is what
  the mockup shows. The cost is that the content is re-created on every open rather than merely revealed,
  so any transient state inside a collapsible has to live outside it.
- **Suggested fix:** put `hidden` (or `display:none`) on `CollapsibleContent`'s root while closed, the way
  Radix's Collapsible does; if the animation needs the box to exist mid-transition, drop it once the
  transition ends rather than leaving it in flow indefinitely.

## TR-019 — `DialogContent` never scrolls, so a dialog taller than the viewport is simply unreachable below the fold

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. DialogContent is a flex column capped at the viewport with a scrolling body and shrink-0 header and footer. As with TR-014 the .tflens-dialog-body max-height 68vh workaround had already gone in August when the dialog became a route; the wrong rationale remained and is corrected. Measured at 390x844 with a real preview loaded: the Import button is at x=154 y=767 203x40, inside the viewport, elementFromPoint hits it, there is no ancestor carrying max-height plus overflow-y, and click trial passes every actionability check. Label read Import 1,479 records.

- **Severity:** Medium — content and controls disappear off the bottom of the screen with no scrollbar and
  no indication that anything is missing, and the consumer has no parameter to turn a scroll on.
- **Repro:** put ~900px of fields into `<Dialog><DialogContent>…<DialogFooter>…</DialogFooter></DialogContent></Dialog>`
  and open it at 1280x800 or 390x844.
- **Expected:** either the content area between `DialogHeader` and `DialogFooter` scrolls (the shadcn/ui
  dialog this mirrors caps the panel at `max-h-[calc(100%-2rem)]` and lets the body scroll, keeping the
  header and the footer pinned), or a `MaxHeight` / `ScrollBody` parameter exists to opt in.
- **Actual:** `DialogContent` renders a fixed, centred panel with no height cap and no `overflow` on any
  of its parts. The panel grows past the viewport, the overlay does not scroll, and the bottom of the
  dialog — including `DialogFooter` and its primary action — is unreachable. `DialogContent` exposes only
  `Class`, `ShowCloseButton` and `ChildContent`; there is no height, scroll or size parameter, and the
  same is true of `DialogHeader` / `DialogFooter` (which additionally capture no unmatched attributes,
  TR-010).
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-040 — the Add-source dialog on `/repos`, whose import mode carries a mode
  fork, four fields, a drop zone, a five-row preview table and a summary. At 390x844 the Import button
  was below the fold and could not be pressed.
- **Workaround:** the page owns the scroll. Everything between the header and the footer is wrapped in a
  single `.tflens-dialog-body` (`Components/Pages/Repos.razor.css`) with `max-height: 68vh; overflow-y:
  auto`, which pins the header and the footer and scrolls the middle. `vh` and `max-h-*` are not in the
  shipped stylesheet either (TR-002), so the rule has to live in the page's scoped CSS rather than in a
  utility class. The cost is that a control scrolled out of the body still reports its true rect to a
  geometry check, so a naive overlap gate sees the clipped control colliding with the footer.
- **Suggested fix:** cap `DialogContent` at the viewport and make the region between `DialogHeader` and
  `DialogFooter` `overflow-y: auto`, as shadcn/ui does; failing that, add a `MaxHeight` parameter and let
  the consumer choose.

## TR-020 — `SelectValue` renders the raw bound value until `SelectContent` has rendered once, so a closed select shows its key rather than its label

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. SelectItems register eagerly now, so the DisplayTextSelector passed purely to stop the trigger showing a raw key was removed from Misses and Effort. Measured on the screen this entry was filed from: the closed period filter on /misses reads All history (default), not the literal all, on first paint without the popover ever being opened - which is BRD-125.

- **Severity:** Medium — the control's resting state shows an internal identifier to the user; the correct
  label only appears after the popover has been opened once, which most readers never do.
- **Repro:** `<Select TValue="string" Value="@objPeriod" ValueChanged="…"><SelectTrigger><SelectValue Placeholder="All history (default)" /></SelectTrigger><SelectContent><SelectItem TValue="string" Value="all" Text="All history (default)">All history (default)</SelectItem>…</SelectContent></Select>`
  with `objPeriod = "all"`, and read the trigger without opening it.
- **Expected:** the trigger shows the selected item's `Text` — that is the whole point of `SelectItem.Text`
  existing beside `Value`, and it is what the shadcn/ui Select this mirrors does.
- **Actual:** the trigger renders the literal string `all`. `SelectItem` registers its `Text` with the
  parent only when it is rendered, and `SelectContent` renders nothing until the popover is opened, so at
  first paint the parent's value→text map is empty and `SelectValue` falls back to `Value.ToString()`.
  Opening the popover once fixes it for the rest of the circuit, which makes it look intermittent.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-035 — the period filter on `/misses` (`data-testid="misses-period"`), which
  must show **All history** on the first view (BRD-125). It showed `all`.
- **Workaround:** pass `DisplayTextSelector` on `Select` — a `Func<TValue, string>` the component consults
  without waiting for the items to render. `Components/Pages/Misses.razor` maps the period key back to its
  option label there. The `Text` on each `SelectItem` is kept so the open popover is unaffected.
- **Suggested fix:** let `SelectItem`s register eagerly (render `SelectContent`'s items into a hidden
  registration pass, or have `Select` collect its children's `Value`/`Text` at parameter-set time) so the
  closed trigger can resolve a label before the popover has ever been opened.

## TR-004 — `Alert` and `Button` have no icon slot that can be combined with child content

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. No change was needed and none was made: the positional-icon convention still works and every Alert and icon Button renders correctly across the auth screens and the report pages, measured at 1280 and 390. Kept as the library documents it.

- **Severity:** Low — documented, but it forces a positional convention rather than a named slot.
- **Repro:** `<Alert Variant="AlertVariant.Danger"><Icon>…</Icon><AlertTitle>…</AlertTitle></Alert>`.
- **Expected:** a named `Icon` fragment usable alongside `AlertTitle` / `AlertDescription`.
- **Actual:** RZ10012 — mixing an explicit fragment with implicit child content is a Razor compile error, so the
  icon has to be the first loose child and the component's CSS positions it by position.
- **Encountered in:** every alert and every icon button on REQ-UI-001..005.
- **Workaround:** place `<LucideIcon>` as the first loose child, as the package's AI reference instructs.
- **Suggested fix:** accept an `Icon` `RenderFragment` and render `ChildContent` beside it, so the two are independent.

## TR-012 — `DataTable` cannot hide its header row, so it cannot render a key/value table

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. DataTable takes ShowHeader now. The ::deep thead { display: none } rules are deleted from Coverage and Profile and replaced by ShowHeader=false. Measured: thead count 0 across the three Harness key/value tables, the two Export facts tables and the Profile table, with their rows intact (3 and 7 on Export, 5 on Profile).

- **Severity:** Low — cosmetic, but it affects every small two-column table.
- **Repro:** `<DataTable ShowToolbar="false" ShowPagination="false">` with two columns.
- **Expected:** a `ShowHeader` parameter beside `ShowToolbar` and `ShowPagination`, since the library ships no
  plain `Table` primitive and the docs direct key/value tables at `DataTable`.
- **Actual:** the `<thead>` always renders. In a label/value table the left cell *is* the label, so the header
  repeats it and adds a strip the design does not have.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-023 (the ten-row key/value table inside each of the three harness columns).
- **Workaround:** declare the headers anyway (the component needs them for its column metadata) and hide the
  row from the page's scoped stylesheet with `.tflens-kv ::deep thead { display: none; }`.
- **Suggested fix:** add `ShowHeader` (default `true`), or ship the plain `Table` / `TableRow` / `TableCell`
  primitives the shadcn design language already defines.

## TR-013 — The `Typography*` components drop every unmatched attribute, so they cannot carry a `data-testid`

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The Typography family splats unmatched values now, so the div wrappers that existed only to carry a test id were deleted and the ids moved onto the components. Measured: the ids resolve to exactly one element each. GateOutcomes line 22 - which cited the never-allocated TR-007 for this - now uses TypographyH2 plus TypographyMuted directly and the stale citation is gone with the workaround it explained. harness-null-footnote keeps its div because it is a real two-child layout row, not an id wrapper.

- **Severity:** Low — but it forces a wrapper element around every asserted line of prose.
- **Repro:** `<TypographyMuted data-testid="harness-null-footnote">…</TypographyMuted>`.
- **Expected:** the attribute lands on the rendered `<p>`, as it does on `Card`, `Alert`, `Badge` and `DataTable`.
- **Actual:** `TypographyMuted` (and its siblings) declare only `ChildContent` and `Class` — there is no
  `[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)]`, so the attribute is a compile-time error rather than markup.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-026 (`data-testid="harness-null-footnote"` on the not-detected footnote line).
- **Workaround:** wrap the typography in a plain `<div>` that carries the test id.
- **Suggested fix:** add the unmatched-values parameter to the `Typography*` family, matching every other
  component in the package.

## TR-015 — `CardHeader` is a CSS grid, so a `Class="flex …"` on it cannot lay out a header row

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. CardHeader honours a caller display class now. The extra flex wrapper div was removed from all four CardHeaders on /effort, whose header is now the mockup's div.card-h one for one. Left in place elsewhere only where the wrapper does real layout work rather than working around the grid.

- **Severity:** Low — the documented shadcn KPI/card pattern does not reproduce without an extra wrapper.
- **Repro:** `<CardHeader Class="flex flex-row items-center justify-between gap-2"><CardTitle>…</CardTitle><Badge>…</Badge></CardHeader>`.
- **Expected:** title and badge on one row, badge pushed right — the composition the package's own AI
  reference prescribes for a KPI card ("`CardHeader class="flex flex-row items-center justify-between pb-2"`").
- **Actual:** each child lands on its own grid row; `justify-between` does nothing. `CardHeader` renders with
  the shipped `data-slot="card-header"` grid rules, and the merged `flex` classes lose to them, so a card
  title, its two badges and its status badge stack into four lines.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-014 (repo cards) and REQ-UI-017 (the Rebuild card).
- **Workaround:** give `CardHeader` a single child `<div class="flex w-full flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-2">`
  and put the real header content inside that.
- **Suggested fix:** either honour a caller-supplied display class in the merge, or correct the AI reference so
  it stops prescribing a layout the component overrides.

## TR-016 — `Badge` has no success/warning variant, so a status badge cannot carry its own semantics

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. BadgeVariant has Success, Info and Warning now, so the three-way distinction this entry was filed for is restored and every tflens-badge-* workaround class is deleted from wwwroot/app.css. Measured after the sweep: 0 stale classes on repos, misses, effort and prices, and real tone spread - repos 22 pills across outline, 10 info blue oklch(.26 .045 250) and 5 success green oklch(.26 .045 155); misses 130 pills across secondary, outline, 27 success, 34 warning amber oklch(.27 .045 80) and 2 destructive. Per-repo status now reads synced=Success, stale=Warning, sync error=Destructive, which is the distinction REQ-UI-014 exists for and which the workaround had collapsed.

- **Severity:** Low — but every "healthy / needs attention / broken" badge collapses to two colours.
- **Repro:** `<Badge Variant="BadgeVariant.Warning">2 streams stale</Badge>`.
- **Expected:** the four alert semantics `Alert` already ships (`Success`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Danger`) are
  available on `Badge` too; the approved mockups use a green "synced" badge and an amber "2 streams stale" badge.
- **Actual:** `BadgeVariant` is `Default | Secondary | Destructive | Outline`. A warning has to borrow
  `Destructive`, which reads as an error, or `Secondary`, which reads as neutral.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-014 (per-repo status badge: synced / stale / sync error).
- **Workaround:** `Secondary` for healthy and `Destructive` for both stale and failed, losing the distinction
  between "this needs attention" and "this is broken".
- **Suggested fix:** add `Success`, `Info` and `Warning` to `BadgeVariant`, reusing the `--alert-*` tokens
  `Alert` already defines.

## TR-017 — `Empty` lives in `TrBlazeUI.Components.Empty`, which the reference's `_Imports` list omits

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The @using TrBlazeUI.Components.Empty line is still how Empty resolves and it is kept. Confirmed the trap is real and still bites: adding InputGroup to Misses.razor without its namespace produced RZ10012 WARNINGS, not errors, and the page compiled and would have rendered a dead <inputgroup> element that did nothing - caught only by reading the warning list. Build is back to 0 warnings with the namespace added.

- **Severity:** Low — silent, and the failure looks like working markup.
- **Repro:** follow §1 "_Imports.razor" of the package's AI reference verbatim, then use `<Empty Title="…">`.
- **Expected:** the component resolves.
- **Actual:** RZ10012 *warning* (not an error), and Razor emits a literal `<empty>` element: the page compiles,
  renders unstyled inline text, and nothing fails. The type is real — `TrBlazeUI.Components.Empty.Empty` — the
  reference's import list simply does not include its namespace, unlike `Alert`, `Badge`, `Card` and the rest.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-014 (the no-repos-on-this-framework state).
- **Workaround:** `@using TrBlazeUI.Components.Empty` on the page. The same trap applies to any other
  namespace missing from that list.
- **Suggested fix:** complete the `_Imports.razor` block in the reference, and ship a `_Imports` snippet
  generated from the assembly so it cannot drift.

## TR-022 — merged into TR-008 (`LucideIcon` does not resolve `lucide.json` aliases)

> **⇢ MERGED 2026-08-28 — see [TR-008](#tr-008--trblazeuiiconslucide-200-does-not-resolve-the-pre-rename-lucide-names-so-every--circle--alert--name-renders-nothing).**

## TR-023 — `BreadcrumbLink` drops every unmatched attribute, so a breadcrumb cannot carry a `data-testid`

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. BreadcrumbLink captures unmatched values now, so the span wrappers inside the links on AddSource and RemoveSource were deleted and the ids moved onto the components. Measured: add-source-back, add-source-title, add-source-description, remove-back, remove-title and remove-description each match exactly one element, carried by a, h2 and button respectively. The runtime 500 on first render this entry was filed for does not recur.

**Severity:** Medium · **Raised:** 2026-08-28 · **Status:** open

`TrBlazeUI.Components.Breadcrumb.BreadcrumbLink` declares no
`[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)]`, so any attribute it does not know about is not ignored
— it **throws**:

```
InvalidOperationException: Object of type 'TrBlazeUI.Components.Breadcrumb.BreadcrumbLink'
does not have a property matching the name 'data-testid'.
```

This is the third component in the same family — `TabsTrigger` (TR-010) and `Typography*` (TR-013)
behave identically — which is what makes it worth raising as a pattern rather than a third one-off.
The cost is not the workaround (a `<span data-testid>` inside the link, which is what TfLens does);
it is that the failure is a **runtime 500 on first render**, not a compile error. Two new pages in
this codebase shipped, built cleanly, and returned a Blazor error page the first time they were
opened — twice, for two different components in the same family.

**Ask:** add `CaptureUnmatchedValues` to every leaf component that renders a real DOM element, or
state in the reference which components accept passthrough attributes and which throw. A consumer
cannot tell by looking, and the build will not tell them either.

**Reproduce:** `<BreadcrumbLink Href="/x" data-testid="y">z</BreadcrumbLink>` → 500 on render.

## TR-024 — `TabsList` takes no unmatched attributes and offers no density variant, so the segmented track cannot be addressed

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. TabsList captures unmatched values now, so the move-the-ground-UP workaround is gone: the data-testid sits on TabsList where the track actually is, bg-muted came off the Tabs root, and the ::deep [role=tablist] flattening rule was deleted from ShellHeader.razor.css. Measured: the track is 34px tall with an 8px radius and 3px inset at 390 and 32px/2px at 1024 and above - exactly the previous geometry - painted once, on the library's own bg-muted oklch(0.269 0 0), with the header holding 64px on all nine screens at both widths. The Tabs family now merging Class properly caused no drift.

**Severity:** Medium · **Raised:** 2026-08-30 · **Status:** open

**Repro.** A segmented control built from `Tabs` / `TabsList` / `TabsTrigger`, where the *track* — the
node TrBlazeUI paints `inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-muted p-1
text-muted-foreground` on — needs to be identified by a test hook and sized to a design spec:

```razor
<Tabs Value="@objValue" ValueChanged="OnChangedAsync">
    <TabsList data-testid="framework-switch">   @* does not compile *@
        <TabsTrigger Value="a">A</TabsTrigger>
    </TabsList>
</Tabs>
```

**Expected.** Either `TabsList` accepts passthrough attributes like `Tabs` does, or `Tabs` exposes the
track's own density (a `Size` / `Density` variant, or a `ListClass`) so a consumer can reach it without
one.

**Actual.** Two separate gaps that compound:

1. `TabsList` declares only `ChildContent` and `Class` — no `AdditionalAttributes`. The markup above
   fails with `Object of type 'TrBlazeUI.Components.Tabs.TabsList' does not have a property matching the
   name 'data-testid'`. This is the same family as TR-010 (`TabsTrigger`), TR-013 (`Typography*`) and
   TR-023 (`BreadcrumbLink`) — the fourth instance, and the second inside `Tabs` alone. Verified against
   `TrBlazeUI.Components.xml` 2.0.0, which lists `AdditionalAttributes` on `Tabs` and on nothing else in
   the family.
2. `Tabs` has no density variant. The track is fixed at `h-10` / `rounded-md` / `p-1` (40px, 6px, 4px).
   A compact header control — the shadcn/ui segmented control every dashboard mockup draws at ~34px —
   has no supported way to ask for that, and `Class` on `Tabs` lands on the *outer* element, not the
   track.

**Encountered in.** `src/TfLens/Components/Shared/FrameworkSwitch.razor` (REQ-UI-010), fixing a BRD-144
mockup-parity finding that fired on all six report pages at both viewport widths: the parity gate reads
chrome off the element carrying the `data-testid`, and that element could only be `Tabs` — which paints
nothing — while the real track sat one level below on `TabsList`, out of reach.

**Workaround.** Move the ground UP: `bg-muted` goes on the `Tabs` root (which does take the testid), and
`TabsList` is flattened back to a bare flex row (`background: transparent; height: auto; padding: 0;
border-radius: 0`) from `ShellHeader.razor.css` via `::deep [role="tablist"]`, so exactly one track is
painted. The 34px / 8px / 3px geometry is written as CSS rather than `Class` utilities because TR-002
still bites — the pre-built `trblazeui.css` carries no arbitrary-value utilities, so `p-[3px]`,
`h-[34px]` and `text-[13px]` are all absent at runtime and silently do nothing.

**Suggested fix.** Add `[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)]` to `TabsList` (and, per TR-023, to
every leaf that renders a real DOM element), and expose the track density on `Tabs` — a `Size` enum, or
at minimum a `ListClass` parameter that reaches the element the library actually styles.

## TR-026 — `DataTableColumn` has width and per-cell class parameters, and the AI reference documents none of them

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The reference documents DataTableColumn's parameter table now, so the entry's substance is met. The whitespace-nowrap recipe on the drift-table's cmd, tier_model and observed-model columns WORKS and is KEPT - this was a documentation defect, not a behaviour one - and only the found-by-decompiling framing was removed from the source comments. Where a figure column was right-aligned through HeaderClass it moved to the new Align parameter (see TR-031).

**Severity:** Medium · **Raised:** 2026-08-30 · **Status:** open

**Repro:** A `DataTable` whose columns hold identifiers with hyphens in them — `fix-issues`,
`claude-opus-5` — inside any container narrower than the table's preferred width.

**Expected:** the reference tells a consumer that a column's width can be constrained, or that a
class can be put on the column's cells, so the id can be kept on one line.

**Actual:** `.trblazeui/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` §"DataTable (Generic)" has a parameter table for
`DataTable` and **no parameter table at all for `DataTableColumn`** — every example shows only
`TData`/`TValue`/`Property`/`Header`/`Sortable`/`Filterable`/`CellTemplate`. The component in fact
ships `Width`, `MinWidth`, `MaxWidth`, `CellClass`, `HeaderClass`, `Format`, `Visible` and `Id`,
which is only discoverable by opening `lib/net10.0/TrBlazeUI.Components.xml` inside the NuGet
package. `CellClass`/`HeaderClass` are exactly the right fix here and were found by decompiling
rather than by reading the docs.

The reason it matters more than a missing table usually would: the rendered table is `w-full`
inside the component's own `overflow-auto` box, so CSS auto table layout **compresses a column
below its own text** rather than letting the box scroll. A hyphen is a soft-wrap opportunity, so
`fix-issues` silently became `fix-` / `issues` in a 54px cell that needed 65px, and
`claude-opus-5` became two lines in an 89px cell that needed 99px. The value is still present and
still not clipped, so nothing in the DOM says it is broken — only a human or a line-count check
sees it. A consumer who cannot find `CellClass` in the reference has no obvious way out.

**Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Routing.razor`, the `drift-table` (REQ-UI-027),
at 1280 and 390.

**Workaround:** `CellClass="whitespace-nowrap" HeaderClass="whitespace-nowrap"` on the `cmd`,
`tier_model` and `observed model` columns. It works exactly as wanted — the class lands on the
`th` and on every `td` of the column, the column's min-content rises to the whole token, and the
overflow lands on the component's own scroll box instead of on the page.

**Suggested fix:** add a `DataTableColumn` parameter table to the AI reference covering `Width` /
`MinWidth` / `MaxWidth` / `CellClass` / `HeaderClass` / `Format` / `Visible` / `Id`, and say in the
`DataTable` section that the table is `w-full` inside a scroll box so columns compress before the
box scrolls — with the nowrap recipe named as the way to hold an identifier column together.

## TR-025 — `DataTable` has no density option, so 160px of a narrow table's width goes to cell padding and only `::deep` can get it back

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-12** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10; replaced every ::deep th,td padding rule with Density="DataTableDensity.Compact" and deleted Coverage.razor.css entirely. Measured 2026-09-12 on an isolated published build with the scoped-CSS bundle verified non-empty: th/td padding 10px a side on all five Coverage repo cards (identical to the deleted rule), stream table 420px in its 422px box at 1280, no Newest date wrapping at either width; on /prices header padding 0/16px and height 36px, body 12px/16px, with per-column classes correctly beating the density base. Compact also trims the vertical axis (py-4 to py-2, header h-9), which the entry did not ask for - flagged for owner UAT.

**Severity:** Low · **Raised:** 2026-08-30 · **Status:** **FIXED upstream — taken up 2026-09-12**

> **This entry was recorded as open until 2026-09-12 and it was wrong.** `DataTable.Density` exists —

**Repro.** A five-column `DataTable` inside a `Card` that is itself half of a two-column grid — the
per-repo stream table on TfLens's Coverage page, one card per repository, `Stream` / `Records` /
`Backfilled` / `Newest` / `Days since`.

**Expected:** a way to ask the component for a tighter table — a `Density` / `Compact` parameter,
or a documented class hook on the cells — the way the same library's `Button` and `Badge` expose
size variants.

**Actual:** cells are hard-coded to `px-4` (16px a side). Measured on the live app at 1280: the
card gives the table a 420px box and the five columns wanted 432px, of which **160px — 38% — was
cell padding**. There is no parameter for it. `DataTable` takes `Class`, and `DataTableColumn`
takes `CellClass` / `HeaderClass` (TR-026), but a Tailwind `px-2.5` passed through `CellClass`
loses to the component's own `px-4`: both are single-class selectors, so the winner is stylesheet
order, and `trblazeui.css` emits `px-4` after `px-2.5`. Passing the smaller padding through the
documented parameter therefore does nothing at all, silently.

**Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Coverage.razor`, `repo-streams-*` (REQ-UI-014 /
BRD-144), at 1280 and 390.

**Workaround:** a scoped-CSS file, `Coverage.razor.css`, whose `.coverage-streams[b-xxxxx] th, td`
selector outranks `.px-4` on specificity rather than on order:

```css
.coverage-streams ::deep th,
.coverage-streams ::deep td { padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; }
```

10px a side gave 60px back across the five columns, which was more than the widened date column
needed, and every card's table then fit its box at 1280 instead of overflowing it.

**Suggested fix:** add a `Density` parameter to `DataTable` (`Comfortable` default, `Compact` at
~8-10px) — a five-column table in a half-width card is an ordinary dashboard shape, not an edge
case. Failing that, say in the reference that `CellClass` cannot override padding and name the
`::deep` recipe, because the parameter appears to work and does not.

## TR-027 — `BreadcrumbList` hard-codes a two-axis `gap` and always wraps, so a two-item trail cannot be held on one line

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-12** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10; deleted the ::deep ol flex-wrap/column-gap rule from ShellHeader.razor.css and moved the desktop half onto the component as ListClass="lg:flex-nowrap lg:gap-x-1". Measured 2026-09-12: the ol computes flex-wrap nowrap, column-gap 4px, row-gap 0 at 1280 and wrap with row-gap 0 at 390; header height holds 64px on all nine screens at both widths, so the 64px-to-87px regression this entry was filed for does not return. Breadcrumb.Wrap and Breadcrumb.ListClass both exist and the shipped ol carries gap-y-0 itself.

**Severity:** Low · **Raised:** 2026-08-30 · **Status:** **FIXED upstream — taken up 2026-09-12**

> **This entry was recorded as open until 2026-09-12 and it was wrong.** Both halves are addressed:
> `Breadcrumb.Wrap` (default `true`, so nothing changed for existing callers) and
> `Breadcrumb.ListClass`, which reaches the `<ol>` the library actually styles; `BreadcrumbList.Class`

>
> The `::deep ol { flex-wrap: nowrap; column-gap: 4px }` rule in `ShellHeader.razor.css` is deleted;
> the desktop half is now `ListClass="lg:flex-nowrap lg:gap-x-1"` on the component. Measured
> 2026-09-12: the `<ol>` computes `flex-wrap: nowrap`, `column-gap: 4px`, `row-gap: 0` at 1280 and
> `wrap` / `row-gap: 0` at 390, with the header holding **64px on all nine screens at both widths** —
> the regression this entry was filed for (64px → 87px) does not return.

**Repro.** The app shell's header is one 64px row at desktop, ending in a fixed-width control cluster;
the breadcrumb is the elastic item in the middle:

```razor
<Breadcrumb>
    <BreadcrumbList>
        <BreadcrumbItem><span>Reports</span></BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbSeparator />
        <BreadcrumbItem><BreadcrumbPage>Harness comparison</BreadcrumbPage></BreadcrumbItem>
    </BreadcrumbList>
</Breadcrumb>
```

`BreadcrumbList` renders `<ol class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2.5 …">`. Two things are fixed
there and neither is a parameter:

* **`flex-wrap` is always on.** A two-item trail under width pressure therefore breaks *between the
  separator and the page name* — `Reports ›` on one line, `Harness comparison` on the next — which
  reads as two rows of chrome rather than one trail. There is no `Wrap` switch, and no
  `CaptureUnmatchedValues` on `BreadcrumbList` to pass `class="flex-nowrap"` either.
* **`gap-2.5` applies to both axes.** 10px is generous for a `›` separator (the approved mockup uses
  6px) and, once the list *has* wrapped, it also inserts 10px of pure vertical padding between the
  two lines, which is what pushed this header from 64px to 87px before it was tracked down.

The second point is the more general one: every `gap-N` in the library is a two-axis gap, so any
wrapping row pays for its column spacing again on every extra row.

**Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Shared/ShellHeader.razor` (REQ-UI-010, REQ-UI-023), at 1280.

**Workaround:** scoped CSS reaching in with `::deep`, because the `ol` is the child component's own
root and cannot carry this file's scope attribute:

```css
@media (min-width: 64rem) {
    .tflens-header-crumb ::deep ol { flex-wrap: nowrap; column-gap: 4px; white-space: nowrap; }
}
```

**Suggested fix:** give `BreadcrumbList` a `Wrap` parameter (default `true`, so nothing changes) and
split its gap into `gap-x-2.5 gap-y-0` — a breadcrumb's rows never want the column spacing between
them. Adding `CaptureUnmatchedValues` would also do, and would settle TR-023's family of cases at the
same time.

## TR-028 — `BarChart` exposes no axis, grid or data-label control and no route to `ApexChartOptions`, so a chart cannot be made to match an approved design

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. Both halves are closed and this was the High-severity entry. BarChart takes Options merged over the wrapper defaults and OptionsConfigurator running last, and ChartContainer takes Bare - so Harness.razor is back on the wrapper and the raw ApexChart escape hatch plus the ::deep rule unpicking the container's card are both deleted. Measured on live data at 1280 and 390: painted gridlines 0 (3 grid elements exist, strokes transparent), y-axis labels 0, bars 3 with distributed fills, and value labels 12.1B, 1.6M and 37.1M all readable - including the two whose bars are sub-pixel against a 12.1B first bar, which is exactly the defect this entry was filed for. Container computes border-top-width 0px, box-shadow none, padding 0px, background transparent. One new defect found while taking this up and filed as TR-037: the Items/XValue/YValue shorthand cannot draw data labels.

**Severity:** High · **Raised:** 2026-09-01 · **Status:** open

**Repro.** `docs/mockups/harness.html` draws *Total tokens by harness* the way a comparison chart is
normally drawn when the values span orders of magnitude: **no y axis, no gridlines, and the value
printed above each bar** (`68.6M`, `19.0M`, `0.61M`). The mockup's own card description names the
components to build it with — `ChartContainer → BarChart`. So:

```razor
<ChartContainer>
    <BarChart TItem="HarnessTokenTotal" Items="@objChartRows" Height="260px" Width="100%"
              ShowLegend="false" ShowTooltip="true">
        <ApexPointSeries TItem="HarnessTokenTotal" Items="@objChartRows" SeriesType="SeriesType.Bar"
                         XValue="@(r => r.Harness)" YValue="@(r => (decimal)r.Tokens)"
                         PointColor="@(r => ChartColourFor(r.Harness))" />
    </BarChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

`BarChart`'s entire public surface for this is `ShowLegend`, `ShowTooltip`, `ShowDataLabels`,
`Height`, `Width`, `BarWidth`. There is **no** `Options`, no `Xaxis`/`Yaxis`, no `Grid`, and no
formatter — so ApexCharts' defaults are the only chart you can have. On this screen's real data
(claude-code 3.2B, opencode 814k, codex 18.5M) the defaults produced:

* a linear y axis printing **raw counts** — `3000000000`, unscaled and unseparated;
* horizontal gridlines and a rounded plot border the design has none of;
* **no value labels at all**, so with claude-code at 3.2B the other two bars were a 0–1px line with
  no figure anywhere near them.

Two of the three numbers the card exists to compare were unreadable. This is not a cosmetic gap: on
a product whose one claim is that its figures can be quoted, a chart that can only render an
unscaled axis is a chart that cannot be shipped.

**Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Harness.razor` (REQ-UI-023), owner UAT 2026-08-30.

**Workaround — drop the wrapper.** `ApexChart<T>` (the component `BarChart` wraps) *does* take
`Options`, so the fix was to stop using `BarChart`:

```razor
<ChartContainer>
    <ApexChart TItem="HarnessTokenTotal" Options="@objChartOptions" Height="260" Width="@("100%")">
        <ApexPointSeries … ShowDataLabels="true" />
    </ApexChart>
</ChartContainer>
```

with `Grid { Show = false }`, `Yaxis = [new YAxis { Show = false }]`, and a `DataLabels.Formatter`
carrying the same compact notation the table cells use. That is the whole value of the wrapper
given up to change three options.

**A second, separable defect found in the same hour:** `ChartContainer` renders its own
`rounded-lg border bg-card shadow-sm p-6` surface. Placed inside a `Card` — which is where a chart
almost always goes, and where both the mockup and the library's own reference put it — it draws a
**card inside a card**: a second bordered, shadowed panel around the plot. There is no `Bare` or
`Variant` switch, so the only way to get the design's flush chart is scoped CSS unpicking the
container's own decoration:

```css
.tflens-chart ::deep > div { border: 0; background: transparent; box-shadow: none; padding: 0; }
```

**Suggested fix:** (1) give `BarChart` (and its siblings) an `Options` parameter merged over the
wrapper's defaults — one parameter settles every case of this shape, rather than growing a
`ShowYAxis` / `ShowGrid` / `LabelFormatter` surface one report at a time. (2) Give `ChartContainer` a
`Bare` parameter, or drop the card chrome entirely and let the caller supply it — a *container* that
paints a card is doing two jobs, and the second one is almost always already done.

## TR-029 — `Badge` is a fixed-height `rounded-full` pill with no wrapping treatment, so a multi-word label collapses into an unreadable shape on a phone

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. Badge takes Wrap and Truncate now. The shortened label on the Playbook stream-health card is restored to the mockup's full sentence - transient, best-effort, absence is not an error - with Wrap=true, measured as rounded-md, one line at 1280 and growing to 102px at 390 without overflowing its pill. The nowrap workaround rules were deleted from Misses and Prices. One new defect found while taking this up and filed as TR-038: Variant=Outline with Truncate=true silently deletes the badge's own text colour.

**Severity:** Medium · **Raised:** 2026-09-01 · **Status:** open

**Repro.** The Playbook stream-health card on `/misses` states each stream's state in a badge, exactly
as `docs/mockups/misses-playbook.html` draws it — including the transient stream, whose state the
mockup writes as a sentence:

```razor
<Badge Variant="BadgeVariant.Outline">transient · best-effort, absence is not an error</Badge>
```

**Expected:** at 390px the label wraps to two or three lines inside a pill that grows with it — which
is what the approved mockups do, in one rule they had to write by hand:

```css
@media (max-width: 700px) {
  .badge { white-space: normal; height: auto; min-height: 22px; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 12px; text-align: left; }
}
```

**Actual:** the shipped badge is `inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs
font-semibold …` — a **fixed-height** pill with a 999px radius and no `white-space` handling. The text
wraps anyway, so at 390 the label spills past a pill that has not grown with it: measured in the
browser, the four-line label overlapped its own rounded ends and the row beside it, and read as two
overlapping shapes rather than one badge. There is no `Truncate`, `Wrap` or size parameter to say
which of the two behaviours the caller wants.

**Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Shared/Playbook/PlaybookMissesSurface.razor` (REQ-UI-051),
1280 and 390 smoke, 2026-09-01.

**Workaround — shorten the label and move the sentence to prose.** The badge now says `transient` and
the card's footer carries "…is transient and best-effort — it is the exporter's input, rotates, and
TfLens never stores it, so its absence is not an error." That is the better copy anyway, so the cost
here was small; it will not be small on a screen whose badge text is data rather than an author's
sentence, and the alternative — a `::deep` rule per component reaching a child's root element, since
scoped CSS cannot reach it directly — is the shape TR-025 and TR-016 already document.

**Suggested fix:** drop the fixed height in favour of a `min-height` and let the pill grow (the
mockups' own rule), or add a `Wrap` / `Truncate` parameter so the caller states which behaviour a long
label should get. Either settles every case; neither needs a new variant.

## TR-030 — `CollapsibleTrigger` renders an `inline-block` button with a bare `class="group"`, so a disclosure header cannot span its own row

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10, which is where the Class parameter this entry asks for already lived - the entry was filed against 2.0.0 and the library could not reproduce it, which was correct. The ::deep .tflens-detail button { width: 100% } rule is deleted from Effort.razor.css and the trigger now carries Class=w-full text-left. Measured at 1280 with the rule confirmed ABSENT from the served bundle: the trigger is 958px in a 960px card and the observation badge sits 16px from its right edge, flush right, which is what the mockup draws.

**Severity:** Low · **Raised:** 2026-09-01 · **Status:** open

**Repro.** The per-phase disclosures on `/effort` are drawn by `docs/mockups/effort.html` as one full
width row: a chevron, the command, a muted summary, a spacer, and an observation badge flush right.

```razor
<Collapsible Open="@vIsOpen" OpenChanged="…">
    <CollapsibleTrigger>
        <span class="tflens-detail-trigger">
            <LucideIcon Name="chevron-down" Size="16" />
            <span class="font-mono">build-phase</span>
            <span class="text-muted-foreground">— 24 runs · 21h 40m · 24.2M output</span>
            <span class="tflens-spacer"></span>
            <Badge Variant="BadgeVariant.Outline">6 of 24 observed</Badge>
        </span>
    </CollapsibleTrigger>
    …
</Collapsible>
```

**Expected:** the trigger fills the row it is placed in — or exposes a parameter, a class hook or a
documented `AsChild` so the caller can say so — the way `SidebarMenuButton` already does for exactly
this layout.

**Actual:** the rendered element is `<button class="group">`, `display: inline-block`, with no width
and no other class. It shrinks to fit its content, so the spacer has nothing to push against and the
badge sits immediately after the summary text rather than at the right edge. `CollapsibleTrigger`
takes no `Class` parameter either, so the only way to reach the button is a `::deep` rule from an
ancestor the consuming page owns — a page's own scoped CSS cannot match a child component's root,
which is the same wall TR-016, TR-025 and TR-029 each end at.

**Workaround:**

```css
.tflens-effort ::deep .tflens-detail button { width: 100%; }
```

**Suggested fix:** add `Class` to `CollapsibleTrigger` (every other TrBlazeUI component that renders a
box has one), or default the trigger to `w-full text-left` since a disclosure header is a row in every
design that has one. The first is the smaller change and settles the general case.

## TR-031 — `DataTableColumn` `HeaderClass="text-right"` does not right-align the header, because the label sits in its own flex box

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. DataTableColumn takes Align now. The ::deep th.text-right > div { justify-content: flex-end } rule is deleted from Prices.razor.css and all four figure columns pass Align=DataTableColumnAlign.End. Measured at 1280 and 390 on an isolated build whose scoped stylesheet was verified live first: each figure header's label box computes justify-content flex-end, the th computes text-align right, and labelRight equals thRight minus paddingRight exactly (1280: 751/878/1051/1230; 390: 270/343/444/547), while the Model column correctly stays flex-start. Also applied on Harness, Repos, AddSource and Effort.

**Severity:** Low · **Raised:** 2026-09-11 · **Status:** open

**Repro.** A money column in a `DataTable`, right-aligned the way every figure column is:

```razor
<DataTableColumn TData="PriceProviderModel" TValue="decimal"
                 Property="@(aRate => aRate.InputPerMillion)" Header="Input"
                 CellClass="text-right tabular-nums" HeaderClass="text-right">
    <CellTemplate Context="vRate">@Usd(vRate.InputPerMillion)</CellTemplate>
</DataTableColumn>
```

**Expected:** the header label sits over the right edge of its column, above the figures, the way
`docs/mockups/prices.html` draws it (`th class="r"`). There is either a column alignment parameter
(`Align="End"`) or `HeaderClass` reaches the label.

**Actual:** the cells right-align and the header does not. The th renders as
`<th class="h-12 px-4 align-middle … text-right"><div class="flex items-center gap-2"><span>Input</span></div></th>`.
`text-right` sets `text-align` on the th, but the label is inside a `div.flex`, where `text-align`
moves nothing. `DataTableColumn` has no `Align` and no `HeaderTemplate`, so no parameter reaches that
div. The label stays at the left of its column while the figures sit at the right. On a phone the
Input and Output headers then read as one run of words over nothing, which the verifier reported
on REQ-UI-072 on 2026-09-11.

**What TfLens did:** one rule in the page's own scoped stylesheet carries the column's
`text-right` one level in. It adds no control and no markup:

```css
.tflens-prices ::deep .tflens-prices-flush th.text-right > div { justify-content: flex-end; }
```

**Suggested fix:** when `HeaderClass` carries `text-right` (or `text-center`), put the matching
`justify-end` (`justify-center`) on the label's flex box. Better, add `Align` (`Start`, `Center`, `End`)
to `DataTableColumn` and apply it to the th, the label box and every cell together. Figure columns
are right-aligned in every table that has figures.

**Not affected:** sorting, cell alignment (`CellClass="text-right"` works on the td), and left-aligned
columns.

## TR-032 — `NativeSelect` renders with `appearance-none` and no arrow, so a select reads as a text box

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The root cause named in this entry was right and is fixed at the merge, not in NativeSelect: TailwindMerge no longer rejects a class because it contains url(, so the library's own chevron survives. The ::deep select { appearance: auto } rule is deleted from Prices.razor.css. Measured on the rendered select: computed background-image is the 368-character url(data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,...) chevron with appearance none - the library's own arrow, where it had been none.

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-11, open)
- **Blocks:** no. One scoped style rule turns the browser's arrow back on and the form works throughout.
- **Repro:** the provider list in the Price providers page's rate form:

  ```razor
  <NativeSelect @bind-Value="objRateProvider" id="prices-rate-provider">
      <option value="anthropic">Anthropic (Claude)</option>
      <option value="openai">OpenAI</option>
  </NativeSelect>
  ```

- **Expected:** a down arrow at the select's right edge, as `docs/mockups/prices.html` draws it and as the component intends: its 2.0.0
  class list carries `appearance-none bg-no-repeat bg-[url('data:image/svg+xml;…m6 9 6 6 6-6…')] bg-[length:1rem]
  bg-[right_0.5rem_center] pr-8` — a chevron as a background image — and `trblazeui.css` ships a rule for that `bg-[url(…)]` class.
- **Actual:** the rendered `<select>` carries all of those except `bg-[url(…)]`, so it has no background image: native arrow off, drawn
  arrow missing, no arrow at all. Beside five text inputs of the same size it reads as a sixth. Measured at 1280 and 390, headless
  Chromium, dark theme, 2026-09-11.
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Prices.razor` (REQ-UI-072), fix-cycle-1 side-by-side with the mockup, 2026-09-11.
- **Workaround:** one rule in the page's own scoped stylesheet, adding no control and no markup:
  `.tflens-prices ::deep .tflens-prices-rates select { appearance: auto; }`.
- **Suggested fix:** get the chevron class onto the rendered element — the class merge appears to drop `bg-[url(…)]`, unconfirmed. Safer
  still, draw it as an element: a `LucideIcon` `chevron-down` over the right edge, as shadcn's NativeSelect does.

**What is NOT affected.** Binding, keyboard use and the option list: a real `<select>` that works. Only the arrow is missing.

## TR-033 — `DataTable`'s search box exists only inside its own toolbar, so a design that puts the table's filter in the card header cannot be built

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. DataTable takes two-way SearchText and a separate ShowColumnChooser now, so the per-miss filter moved into the card header where docs/mockups/misses.html draws it, on both framework axes, with ShowToolbar=false. Measured: typing narrows the grid 25 rows to 0 to 2. REQ-UI-052's test was updated in the same change to locate miss-detail-search in the miss-detail card rather than inside miss-detail-table, as this entry's deviation note required. Taking it up also exposed that the Playbook grid's columns had never been marked Filterable, so its toolbar box had been filtering nothing - fixed.

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-11, open)
- **Blocks:** no. The filter works, above the table rather than in the card header, with a `Columns` button the design lacks.
- **Repro:** the per-miss table on `/misses`, filterable by REQ, class and whose gap:

  ```razor
  <DataTable TData="MissRow" Data="@DetailRows" ShowToolbar="true" ShowPagination="true" …>
  ```

- **Expected:** a way to put the grid's search box where the design puts it — `docs/mockups/misses.html` draws it in the card header
  opposite the title (`<input class="input lead sm" placeholder="Filter by REQ, class or whose gap">`). A two-way `SearchText`, or a
  `ToolbarContent` slot, would settle it.
- **Actual:** `ShowToolbar` is the only control and is all-or-nothing: `true` renders the library's toolbar — search input *and*
  column-visibility `Columns` dropdown — above the grid, inside its own box; `false` renders neither and exposes no filter state. Drawing
  the header filter needs a second hand-written filter over `DetailRows`, which the grid's `Filterable` columns would not feed.
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Misses.razor` (REQ-UI-038 / REQ-UI-053), fix-cycle-1 side-by-side with the mockup,
  2026-09-11.
- **Workaround:** none, deliberately. REQ-UI-052's test locates the search box *inside* `miss-detail-table` and asserts typing narrows the
  rows, so moving it would break that test or duplicate the filter. Recorded as a deviation in
  `tests/.artifacts/verify/misses-fix/findings-verdict.md`.
- **Suggested fix:** add `@bind-SearchText` (and, separately, `ShowColumnChooser`) so a caller can host the search input anywhere and
  still drive the grid's filtering; a `ToolbarContent` slot would do as well.

**What is NOT affected.** The filtering itself, `Filterable` columns, sorting and pagination. Only where the search box can be drawn.

## TR-034 — `Badge` always renders a `<div>`, so a pill cannot sit inside a sentence and cannot match a design that draws one as a `<span>`

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. Badge renders a span now, with As=div as the escape hatch. Measured: every badge on the report screens is a SPAN. On /effort - the screen this entry was filed from - 5 of the 6 permanent positional mockup-parity findings now key correctly, which is what the entry predicted. Swept the whole repository for div-keyed badge selectors and Playwright locators: exactly one existed, ShellHeader.razor.css line 131, and it is de-tagged. The non-wrapping half of the change did bite once and was caught: at 390 the Coverage repo-card title overlapped its status pill by 19px, fixed with flex-wrap plus md:flex-nowrap and re-measured to 0 overlaps.

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-11, open)
- **Blocks:** no. Every pill on `/effort` renders and reads correctly; the findings are adjudicated as tool artefacts.
- **Repro:** any count pill in running text, e.g. the phase table's caption row on `/effort`:

  ```razor
  <Badge Variant="BadgeVariant.Outline" Class="tflens-nowrap-badge">
      @objPhases.Phases.Count phases · @objPhases.RunsLive runs
  </Badge>
  ```

- **Expected:** the element `Badge` renders can be inline — an `As`/`Element` parameter, or the `AsChild` pattern the triggers use
  (`<Badge AsChild><span>…</span></Badge>`) — because a pill is an inline object: `docs/mockups/effort.html` writes every one as
  `<span class="badge …">`, and three of this page's pills sit next to inline text.
- **Actual:** the markup is always `<div class="inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-semibold …">`.
  `inline-flex` makes it look inline, but a `<div>` cannot sit inside a `<p>` without invalid HTML, and the mockups'
  `<span class="badge">` can never be matched element-for-element. On `/effort` that is six permanent `mockup-parity` findings across two
  widths, on pills plainly on screen, because the gate keys elements by tag and index
  (`tests/.artifacts/verify/effort-fix/findings-verdict.md`, verdict 10).
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Effort.razor` (REQ-UI-045 … REQ-UI-049), fix cycle 1 side-by-side with
  `docs/mockups/effort.html`, 2026-09-11.
- **Workaround:** none — there is no parameter to set. The pills are left as the library draws them.
- **Suggested fix:** `AsChild` on `Badge` (as `DialogTrigger`, `SheetTrigger`, … have), or an `As="span"` parameter. `span` would be the
  better default: shadcn/ui's own Badge moved to `<span>` for this reason.

**What is NOT affected.** The variants, the colours, `Class`, and pills standing alone in a flex row — most of them.

## TR-035 — `SidebarProvider`'s phone menu is sized with `--sidebar-width`, so the `--sidebar-width-mobile` the stylesheet defines is never read

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-13** — re-checked here: Upgraded to 2.1.0-ci.10. The phone sheet reads --sidebar-width-mobile itself now. The compounding @media (max-width: 47.999rem) { :root { --sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-mobile) } } rule is DELETED from wwwroot/app.css, which this entry warned was mandatory or it would double up. Measured at 390: the slid-out menu is 288px (18rem), was 256px, on an opaque oklch(0.169 0 0) panel, and --sidebar-width now reads 16rem at every width where it had been overridden to 18rem below 768px. SidebarProvider's new Width, MobileWidth and IconWidth were deliberately not used - TfLens wants exactly the tokens.

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-11, open)
- **Blocks:** no. The phone menu opens, paints and navigates; one `:root` rule restores the designed width.
- **Repro:** any `SidebarProvider` / `Sidebar Collapsible="true"` shell opened below 768px, where the sidebar is the phone sheet:

  ```razor
  <SidebarProvider DefaultOpen="true" HeightClass="h-screen" CookieKey="tflens:sidebar">
      <Sidebar Collapsible="true">…</Sidebar>
      <SidebarInset>…</SidebarInset>
  </SidebarProvider>
  ```

- **Expected:** the slid-out menu is `--sidebar-width-mobile` wide — 18rem — the value `trblazeui.css` defines beside
  `--sidebar-width: 16rem` and `--sidebar-width-icon: 3rem`, and the width `docs/mockups/misses.html` draws it at
  (`@media (max-width:767px){.sidebar{width:18rem}}`).
- **Actual:** the sheet renders as `<div class="… sm:max-w-sm w-[var(--sidebar-width)] bg-sidebar p-0 flex flex-col" data-side="left">` —
  `--sidebar-width`, not `--sidebar-width-mobile`. Measured at 390px: 256px against the mockup's 288px. `--sidebar-width-mobile` is
  defined in `:root` and read by nothing in the stylesheet or the component set, and `SidebarProvider` exposes no width parameter.
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor` (REQ-UI-006), fix cycle 1 side-by-side with
  `docs/mockups/{misses,effort,prices}.html` at 390px, 2026-09-11.
- **Workaround:** one rule in the app's own stylesheet, in the band where the desktop sidebar is `display: none` and nothing else reads
  the token — the route already taken for TR-028 … TR-031:

  ```css
  @media (max-width: 47.999rem) {
      :root { --sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-mobile); }
  }
  ```

- **Suggested fix:** size the phone sheet with `w-[var(--sidebar-width-mobile)]` — a one-word change that makes the shipped token mean
  something — or expose `MobileWidth` / `Width` parameters on `SidebarProvider` so a consumer can state both.

**What is NOT affected.** The desktop column, the 3rem icon rail, the backdrop, the slide animation, and the controls inside the menu.
Only the phone panel's width.

## TR-036 — `Primitives.Select.SelectContent<T>.DisposeAsync()` awaits two JS references without catching `JSDisconnectedException`, so every navigation away from a page holding a `Select` logs an unhandled circuit exception

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-12, open against **2.1.0-ci.10**)
- **Blocks:** no. Log noise on a healthy build: 2 occurrences across a full published smoke of `/repos`,
  `/repos/add` and `/repos/remove/{source}` at 1280 and 390, with `#blazor-error-ui` **hidden
  throughout**. Nothing the user sees, nothing that fails.
- **Not a 2.1.0 regression.** The same single `JSDisconnectedException` reference count is present in
  2.0.0's Primitives assembly, so this has always been there. It is filed now only because this is the
  first pass that read the circuit log on a clean build. It is not in the 32 entries above.
- **Repro:** open any page carrying a `Select` (TfLens: the period filter on `/misses`, the provider
  list on `/prices`), then navigate away. Read the server log.
- **Expected:** nothing. A circuit teardown is the ordinary way a Blazor Server page ends, and a JS
  reference belonging to a dead circuit cannot be disposed — the framework's own guidance is to swallow
  `JSDisconnectedException` on that path.
- **Actual:** `ERR Unhandled exception in circuit`. `SelectContent.DisposeAsync()`
  (`src/TrBlazeUI.Primitives/Primitives/Select/SelectContent.razor:294`) awaits
  `objClickOutsideModule.DisposeAsync()` and `objJsModule.DisposeAsync()` with no `try`/`catch` around
  either. When the circuit has already gone, both throw.
- **The library already knows the pattern, which is what makes this a defect rather than an omission.**
  Its sibling in the same folder, `Primitives/Dialog/DialogContent.razor`, catches
  `JSDisconnectedException` in **both** its setup path (line 189, *"Circuit is gone — nothing to listen
  for"*) and its dispose path (line 250, *"Circuit already torn down — the trap died with it"*).
  Ten files across `Primitives` and `Components` handle it; twelve files in `Primitives` alone hold an
  `IJSObjectReference`. `SelectContent` is on the wrong side of that split.
- **Encountered in:** TfLens `*build-phase` 2026-09-12, cluster E, on the published smoke of `/repos`.
- **Workaround:** none needed and none taken. The log line is tolerated.
- **Suggested fix:** wrap each `await …DisposeAsync()` in `SelectContent.DisposeAsync()` in
  `try { … } catch (JSDisconnectedException) { }`, exactly as `DialogContent` does. Better, audit the
  twelve `Primitives` files holding an `IJSObjectReference` against the ten that handle the exception —
  the two lists should be the same list.

**What is NOT affected.** The control itself: binding, the popover, keyboard use, `SelectItem`
registration and `DisplayTextSelector` all work, and the exception fires only on teardown, after the
page is gone. No figure, no render, no user-visible behaviour.

> **⚠ One consequence worth knowing when reading a smoke log.** On a *healthy* build this is two log
> lines and a hidden error banner. On an instance poisoned by the shared-`obj/` corruption recorded as
> **TF-043** in `docs/TfLens-TechieFlow-Feedback.md`, it fired on every screen and **raised the
> `#blazor-error-ui` banner** — so a cluster smoking against a contended `dotnet run` will see a red
> banner that is not its own and is not caused by its own change. Check the bundle before believing it.

## TR-037 — `BarChart`'s `Items` / `XValue` / `YValue` shorthand cannot draw data labels, so `ShowDataLabels="true"` is silently ignored — including in the example the library's own reference gives for it

- **Severity:** Medium (raised 2026-09-12, open against **2.1.0-ci.10**)
- **Blocks:** no. The chart draws its bars; only the value labels are missing, and TfLens prints every
  charted figure in the table beside the chart regardless (`docs/TfLens-UIDesign.md` §Library gaps). The
  wrapper's other form works, so there is a supported way to get the labels.
- **This is the tail of TR-028, not a repeat of it.** TR-028 asked for a route to `ApexChartOptions` and
  got one; `Options` and `OptionsConfigurator` work exactly as the reply describes. This is a separate
  defect met while taking that fix up: the *shorthand* series form cannot express a data label at all.
- **Repro:** the form the reference documents — no child content, data supplied through the triplet:

  ```razor
  <ChartContainer Bare="true">
      <BarChart TItem="HarnessTokens" Items="@objRows" ShowDataLabels="true"
                XValue="@(aRow => aRow.Harness)" YValue="@(aRow => (decimal)aRow.Tokens)" />
  </ChartContainer>
  ```

- **Expected:** the value sits above each bar. `ShowDataLabels` is a documented `ChartBase` parameter,
  and `ChartBase.cs:384` really does write `options.DataLabels ??= new DataLabels { Enabled = ShowDataLabels }`.
- **Actual:** no labels, no error, no warning. Measured in the live ApexCharts config: `dataLabels: []`
  and `dataLabels.enabled: false`. Setting it the other two ways does not help either — passing
  `Options` with `DataLabels.Enabled = true`, or setting it in `OptionsConfigurator`, is overwritten
  just the same.
- **Root cause.** `Blazor-ApexCharts`' `ApexChart<TItem>.SetDataLabels()` rewrites
  `Options.DataLabels.Enabled` unconditionally from the flags on its *series*, and it runs after
  everything the wrapper does. `BarChart.razor`'s built-in default series —

  ```razor
  <ApexPointSeries TItem="TItem" Items="@DefaultItems" Name="@DefaultSeriesName"
                   SeriesType="SeriesType.Bar" XValue="@DefaultXValue" YValue="@DefaultYValue" />
  ```

  — never sets `ShowDataLabels`, so it defaults to false and the series flag wins over the chart
  parameter, the `Options` member and the configurator alike. The chart parameter is therefore
  unreachable in this form: it is not that it loses a merge, it is that nothing downstream reads it.
- **The reference documents the combination that does not work.** `ChartBase.cs:137-141`, the
  `<example>` block on `OptionsConfigurator` — the parameter added by TR-028's own fix — is:

  ```razor
  <BarChart TItem="Total" Items="@objRows" ShowDataLabels="true"
            OptionsConfigurator="@(o => o.DataLabels.Formatter = "function (v) { return (v/1e6).toFixed(1) + 'M' }")" />
  ```

  That is the shorthand form with `ShowDataLabels="true"`, so it renders a formatter for labels that
  never appear. A consumer copying it gets a chart with no labels and nothing to tell them why. This is
  the same shape as TR-005: a documented API that does not do what the document says.
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Harness.razor` (REQ-UI-023) and
  `src/TfLens/Components/Pages/Routing.razor` (REQ-UI-028), 2026-09-12, while taking up TR-028.
  On `/harness` two of the three bars are sub-pixel against a 12.1B first bar, so the labels are the
  only way to read the comparison — which is why TR-028 was filed High in the first place.
- **Workaround — use the wrapper's nested form instead of the shorthand.** Supply the series
  explicitly and set the flag on it:

  ```razor
  <BarChart TItem="HarnessTokens" Options="@objOptions" OptionsConfigurator="@ConfigureLabels">
      <ApexPointSeries TItem="HarnessTokens" Items="@objRows" SeriesType="SeriesType.Bar"
                       ShowDataLabels="true"
                       XValue="@(aRow => aRow.Harness)" YValue="@(aRow => (decimal)aRow.Tokens)" />
  </BarChart>
  ```

  This stays inside the wrapper — no raw `ApexChart`, no property-order projection — and `Options`,
  `OptionsConfigurator` and `ChartContainer Bare` all behave. Cost: the shorthand's whole benefit.
- **Suggested fix:** pass the chart's `ShowDataLabels` down to the built-in default series in
  `BarChart.razor` and its five siblings — a one-attribute change on each,
  `ShowDataLabels="@ShowDataLabels"` — so the parameter reaches the only thing that reads it. Failing
  that, correct the `OptionsConfigurator` example so it does not demonstrate an ineffective
  combination, and say in the reference that `ShowDataLabels` requires the nested series form.

**What is NOT affected.** Bars, colours, `Options`, `OptionsConfigurator`, `ChartContainer.Bare`, the
axis and grid suppression TR-028 asked for, tooltips, legends, and the nested `ApexPointSeries` form —
all measured working on `/harness` at 1280 and 390. Only the shorthand's data labels.

## TR-038 — `Badge Variant="Outline" Truncate="true"` silently deletes the badge's own text colour, because `text-ellipsis` still falls through TailwindMerge's bare `text-(colour)` pattern

- **Severity:** Low (raised 2026-09-12, open against **2.1.0-ci.10**)
- **Blocks:** no. The badge renders, truncates and reads; it inherits its parent's colour instead of
  declaring `text-foreground`, which in TfLens's header happens to be the same colour. It is filed
  because the mechanism is general and the next pairing may not be so lucky.
- **This is the residue of a fix that was made, not a fix that was missed.** The 2026-09-12 CHANGELOG
  records that `text-left` / `text-center` / `text-right` / `text-justify` / `text-start` / `text-end`
  were pulled out into a **`text-align` conflict group**, because they "previously fell through to the
  bare `text-([a-z]+)` colour pattern, so `text-right` and `text-muted-foreground` conflicted". That is
  exactly right, and it is exactly what still happens to **`text-ellipsis`** — `text-overflow` never
  got the same treatment.
- **Repro — measured directly against the shipped assembly**, by reflecting `ClassNames.cn` out of
  `TrBlazeUI.Components` 2.1.0-ci.10 and passing `Badge`'s own literals, so nothing about TfLens is in
  the picture. Every `BadgeVariant` × { default, `Truncate`, `Wrap` }, 18 combinations:

  | variant | mode | keeps its own `text-*` colour? | radius | truncation classes kept |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **Outline** | **`Truncate`** | **NO — `text-foreground` deleted** | `rounded-full` | all three |
  | Outline | default / `Wrap` | yes | `rounded-full` / `rounded-md` | — |
  | Default · Secondary · Destructive · Success · Warning | all three modes | yes | correct | all three |

  One cell in eighteen. `Outline` is the only variant whose colour class is the **bare**
  `text-foreground`; every other variant's is `text-primary-foreground`, `text-alert-success-foreground`
  and so on. The bare form is the one the `text-([a-z]+)` colour pattern matches, so `text-ellipsis`
  lands in the same conflict group, arrives later, and wins.
- **Expected:** `Truncate` decides what a long label does. It should not be able to change the badge's
  colour, any more than `text-right` should have been able to.
- **Actual:** `cn(…, "text-foreground", "max-w-full overflow-hidden text-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap")`
  returns a class list with **no** `text-foreground`. The three truncation classes are all present and
  correct — `Truncate` itself works.
- **Encountered in:** `src/TfLens/Components/Shared/SyncNowButton.razor` — the last-sync badge is
  `<Badge Variant="BadgeVariant.Outline" Truncate="true">`, the one affected combination in the app.
- **Workaround:** none taken and none needed here — the header's inherited colour matches
  `--foreground`, so nothing is visibly wrong. A caller who does need the colour can pass
  `Class="text-foreground"`, which is merged last and therefore survives.
- **Suggested fix:** give `text-overflow` its own conflict group in `TailwindMerge` — `text-ellipsis`
  and `text-clip` — beside the `text-align` group added on 2026-09-12. The same audit is worth running
  over every other bare `text-*` utility that is not a colour (`text-wrap`, `text-nowrap`,
  `text-balance`, `text-pretty`), since each will have the identical fall-through.

**What is NOT affected.** Truncation itself — `max-w-full`, `overflow-hidden` and `text-ellipsis` all
survive the merge on every variant, verified above. `Wrap` on every variant, including its
`rounded-md` correctly beating the base `rounded-full`. Every non-`Outline` variant's colour under
`Truncate`. And `As`, which is unrelated.

> **How this was first reported, and what the wrong report was actually caused by — kept because the
> failure mode is the point.** Cluster D filed this as *"`Badge.Truncate` does not truncate —
> `Truncate="true"` and the default render an identical set of truncation classes"* and restored a
> `::deep` ellipsis rule on that basis. The class-composition probe above disproved the stated cause,
> and cluster D then re-measured on an instance whose scoped CSS was proved live first, and
> **withdrew the finding**:
>
> ```
> Truncate="true"   cls: … max-w-full overflow-hidden text-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap
>                   computed: text-overflow ellipsis · overflow hidden · max-width 100%
>                   text-foreground: ABSENT          ← TR-038, exactly as predicted
> default (Outline) cls: … text-foreground whitespace-nowrap
>                   computed: text-overflow clip · overflow visible · max-width none
> ```
>
> **The cause was a stale binary, not the merge.** Both original probe runs hit an app published from
> the shared `src/TfLens/obj/` while other clusters were building; its `TfLens.dll` predated the
> `Truncate="true"` edit, so it was faithfully rendering the *old markup*. This is a fourth face of
> **TF-043** and the nastiest yet: the stylesheet was fine, the page rendered, nothing errored — the
> DLL was simply older than the source. A scoped-CSS liveness gate does not catch it. **The lesson is
> the one the framework entry now carries: on a contended tree, a measurement is only evidence if the
> thing measured is known to be newer than the change.**
>
> The `::deep` rule stays: `min-width: 0` is still load-bearing, because `max-w-full` caps width and
> does not let a flex item shrink below its content. The other three declarations are now redundant
> and are labelled belt-and-braces at both call sites.
