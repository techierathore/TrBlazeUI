# TrBlazeUI Feedback — surfaced during TrStudio

## Summary
- **1 blocker (TR-011)**, 3 major (TR-001, TR-002, TR-007), 6 minor (TR-003, TR-005, TR-006, TR-008, TR-009, TR-010), 1 nice-to-have (TR-004)
- Theme: leaf components (`DataTable`, `Alert`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`) don't splat `CaptureUnmatchedValues`; several AI-reference APIs (`FileUpload.OnFilesSelected`, `Empty*` family, `Pagination`, Icon slot) diverge from the shipped 1.0.7 surface; `DataTable` also keeps a min-content wider than a ≤400px viewport (TR-010, cosmetic). All worked around; no build blocked — **except TR-011 (2026-07-12): the 1.0.7 packages' `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` FrameworkReference makes the MAUI Mac Catalyst head unbuildable on a real Mac (NETSDK1082); no workaround shipped.**
- Entries retain their append-only IDs; read TR-011 (blocker) then TR-001/002/007 (major) first.
- Last consolidated: 2026-07-07 (TR-011 appended 2026-07-12)

### ✅ Resolution status — ALL 11 RESOLVED library-side (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015)
Every issue is fixed in the library source (or corrected in the AI reference). Verified three ways:
a **strict Release build** (`dotnet build TrBlazeUI.sln -c Release -p:CI=true` → **0 warning / 0 error**);
a **pack-and-inspect** of all three nupkgs (Primitives / Components / Icons.Lucide → **0 `<frameworkReferences>`** in every nuspec — the exact pipeline check TR-011 asked for);
and a **headless-Chromium runtime smoke** on a Blazor Server demo page exercising each fix (**14/14** checks: `data-testid` splats present on the rendered DOM, table render-truth, gated-vs-uncontrolled Switch behaviour, and `documentElement.scrollWidth == 390` at a 390px viewport, plus a desktop + mobile visual pass).

| ID | Severity | Fix kind | Status |
|----|----------|----------|--------|
| TR-001 | major | code (DataTable splat) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-002 | major | code (Alert splat) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-003 | minor (doc) | doc (inline-icon pattern) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-004 | nice-to-have | verified already-splatting | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-005 | minor (doc) | doc (flat `Empty` API) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-006 | minor (doc) | doc (composite `Pagination` API + namespace) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-007 | major | code (`OnFilesSelected` alias) + doc | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-008 | minor | code (Checkbox/Switch splat) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-009 | minor | code (controlled Switch) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-010 | minor | code (`min-w-0` root) | ✅ Resolved |
| TR-011 | blocker | build (`AddRazorSupportForMvc` removed) | ✅ Resolved |

> **Publish note:** these fixes ship when the package versions are bumped (> 1.0.7) and pushed. The current source packs clean nuspecs (verified); TrStudio should consume the next published Components/Primitives/Icons.Lucide versions.

## Issues

<!-- Append entries as gaps are found. IDs are append-only, never renumbered.
     TrBlazeUI → TR-NNN -->

### TR-001 — `DataTable<T>` does not support CaptureUnmatchedValues
- **Severity:** major
- **Repro:** `<DataTable TItem="Row" Items="rows" data-testid="registry-table">` (any arbitrary/`data-*` attribute)
- **Expected:** pass-through of unmatched attributes (`data-testid`, `id`, `data-*`) to the rendered root, like well-behaved Blazor components.
- **Actual:** throws `InvalidOperationException: … does not have a property matching the name 'data-testid'` → 500 at render.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-071 (admin registry table), REQ-UI-051 (projects history table — anticipated).
- **Workaround:** put test/identity attributes on a wrapping `<div>`; never on `<DataTable>`.
- **Suggested fix:** add `[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)] public IDictionary<string,object>? AdditionalAttributes` and splat it onto the table root.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** added `[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)] public Dictionary<string,object>? AdditionalAttributes` to `DataTable<TData>` and splatted it onto the root wrapper via `@attributes` (`DataTable.razor` root `<div>`, `DataTable.razor.cs`). Smoke: `<DataTable … data-testid="registry-table">` renders HTTP 200 with the `data-testid` on the root and rows (`Alpha`/`Active`) present — no more 500.

### TR-002 — `Alert` does not support CaptureUnmatchedValues
- **Severity:** major
- **Repro:** `<Alert Severity="Danger" data-testid="auth-failure-alert">…</Alert>`
- **Expected:** unmatched-attribute pass-through (same as TR-001).
- **Actual:** same `InvalidOperationException` throw / 500.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-001 (login failure alert), REQ-UI-002/003 (register/forgot alerts).
- **Workaround:** wrap `<Alert>` in a `<div data-testid=…>`.
- **Suggested fix:** same as TR-001 — splat unmatched attributes.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** added `AdditionalAttributes` (`CaptureUnmatchedValues`) to `Alert` and splatted `@attributes` onto the `role="alert"` root div (`Alert.razor`, `Alert.razor.cs`). Smoke: `<Alert Variant="AlertVariant.Danger" data-testid="auth-failure-alert">` renders with the `data-testid` on the root and its text visible.

### TR-003 — `Button.Icon` / `Alert.Icon` slot syntax in the AI reference does not compile
- **Severity:** minor (doc bug)
- **Repro:** the `Icon="…"` / `<Icon>` slot form shown in `.trblazeui/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md`.
- **Expected:** compiles and renders the icon per the documented example.
- **Actual:** `RZ10012 "unexpected element"`; silently renders literal elements.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-005/001..004/070/071 (throughout).
- **Workaround:** put an inline `<LucideIcon .../>` as the first child of the `<Button>`/`<Alert>` (the pattern used in `Home.razor`).
- **Suggested fix:** correct the AI reference to the working inline-first-child pattern, or implement the documented slot.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** corrected `docs/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` — both the Button and Alert examples now use the inline-first-child pattern, with an explicit note that `Button`/`Alert` *do* have an `Icon` render-fragment parameter but mixing an explicit `<Button.Icon>`/`<Alert.Icon>` fragment with loose child content is the Razor compile error (RZ10012) the reference used to trigger. (Root cause: named-fragment + implicit-content mixing, not a missing slot.)

### TR-004 — `Badge` / `FieldError` CaptureUnmatchedValues unverified
- **Severity:** nice-to-have
- **Repro:** attempting `data-testid` on `<Badge>`/`<FieldError>`.
- **Expected:** attribute pass-through.
- **Actual:** unverified — routed test ids to wrappers defensively after TR-001/002.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-071 (badges), REQ-UI-001/002 (field errors).
- **Workaround:** wrapper elements carry the test attributes.
- **Suggested fix:** audit all leaf components for consistent CaptureUnmatchedValues support.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** audited. `Badge` and `FieldError` **already** declared `AdditionalAttributes` (`CaptureUnmatchedValues`) and splatted `@attributes` onto their roots — no change needed. Smoke confirms `<Badge data-testid="count-badge">` and `<FieldError data-testid="pw-error">` both carry the attribute on the rendered DOM. The audit closed the gaps that did exist: `DataTable`/`Alert` (TR-001/002) and `Checkbox`/`Switch` (TR-008).

### TR-005 — `Empty` component family does not exist / doesn't compile
- **Severity:** minor
- **Repro:** the `<Empty>` / `<EmptyIcon>` / `<EmptyTitle>` / `<EmptyDescription>` / `<EmptyAction>` composite shown in `.trblazeui/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md`.
- **Expected:** a reusable empty-state component set per the reference.
- **Actual:** emits `RZ10012` unresolved-element warnings — the family isn't shipped in TrBlazeUI 1.0.7.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-074 (sources empty state), REQ-UI-076 (no-sources / no-results states).
- **Workaround:** hand-rolled empty states with plain markup.
- **Suggested fix:** ship the `Empty*` family, or remove it from the AI reference.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** the `Empty` component *does* ship — but with a **flat** API (`Title`/`Description` strings, an `Icon` render fragment, a `Size`, and `ChildContent` for actions), not the `EmptyIcon`/`EmptyTitle`/`EmptyDescription`/`EmptyAction` composite the reference invented. Corrected the AI reference to the real flat API (with the same explicit-vs-implicit fragment caveat as TR-003). No component change — the shipped `Empty` is fine; only the doc was wrong.

### TR-006 — `Pagination` namespace + API differ from the reference
- **Severity:** minor
- **Repro:** `<Pagination CurrentPage=… TotalPages=… OnPageChanged=… />` per the reference.
- **Expected:** usable from the shared `_Imports` with the documented `CurrentPage`/`TotalPages`/`OnPageChanged` API.
- **Actual:** lives in `TrBlazeUI.Components.Pagination` (not in the shared `_Imports`); top-level API differs from the doc.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-076 (model-library footer pager).
- **Workaround:** substituted a Button-based pager.
- **Suggested fix:** align the component's namespace/API with the AI reference (or vice-versa).
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** aligned the doc to the shipped component (chose doc-side, since the composite is the real design and `DataTable` embeds it). The AI reference now documents the real composite API — `PaginationContent` + `PaginationItem` + `PaginationPrevious`/`PaginationLink`/`PaginationNext` (or a `State`-driven `PaginationState`) — and calls out that it lives in `TrBlazeUI.Components.Pagination`, which is **not** in the global `_Imports`, so consumers must add `@using TrBlazeUI.Components.Pagination`.

### TR-007 — `FileUpload.OnFilesSelected` doesn't exist; real API is `FilesChanged`
- **Severity:** major
- **Repro:** `<FileUpload OnFilesSelected="Handler" />` exactly as `.trblazeui/TrBlazeUI-AI-Reference.md` documents.
- **Expected:** the documented `OnFilesSelected` callback fires on selection.
- **Actual:** throws `InvalidOperationException` at render → terminates the Blazor circuit. The real 1.0.7 API is `FilesChanged` (`EventCallback<IReadOnlyList<FileUploadItem>>`) + a `Files` property.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-030 (voice clone upload); also affects the REQ-UI-020 image-studio reference example.
- **Workaround:** use `FilesChanged`/`Files`.
- **Suggested fix:** correct the AI reference to the shipped `FilesChanged` API (or add an `OnFilesSelected` alias).
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** did both. Added an `OnFilesSelected` `EventCallback<IReadOnlyList<FileUploadItem>>` **alias** to `FileUpload` that fires in tandem with `FilesChanged` (via a shared `NotifyFilesChangedAsync()` at every change site) so reference-following code compiles and runs; **and** corrected the AI reference to document the primary `Files`/`FilesChanged` API, noting `OnFilesSelected` is the back-compat alias.

### TR-008 — `Checkbox` does not support CaptureUnmatchedValues
- **Severity:** minor
- **Repro:** `<Checkbox data-testid="synthetic" @bind-Value="v" />`.
- **Expected:** unmatched-attribute pass-through.
- **Actual:** `InvalidOperationException` at render (same non-splatting class as TR-001/002, but `Checkbox` wasn't on that list).
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-030 (synthetic-voice checkbox); **also `Switch`** — REQ-UI-010/011 confirmed `<Switch data-testid>` throws `ThrowForUnknownIncomingParameterName` (same class). So the confirmed non-splatting leaf set is now: `DataTable`, `Alert`, `Checkbox`, `Switch` (Badge/FieldError unverified).
- **Workaround:** move `data-*` to a wrapping element/label.
- **Suggested fix:** part of the leaf-component CaptureUnmatchedValues audit (see TR-004).
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** the underlying *primitives* (`Primitives.Checkbox`, `Primitives.Switch`) already splatted; the gap was in the styled Components-layer wrappers. Added `AdditionalAttributes` (`CaptureUnmatchedValues`) to `Components.Checkbox` and `Components.Switch` and forwarded `@attributes` down to the primitive (`Checkbox.razor`/`.cs`, `Switch.razor`/`.cs`). Smoke: `<Checkbox data-testid="synthetic">` and `<Switch data-testid="nsfw-plain">` both render with the attribute on the DOM — no `ThrowForUnknownIncomingParameterName`.

### TR-009 — `Switch` keeps optimistic internal state (diverges from controlled `Checked`)
- **Severity:** minor
- **Repro:** a controlled `<Switch Checked="@v" CheckedChanged="Intercept" />` where `Intercept` does NOT change `v` (e.g. it opens a confirmation dialog first).
- **Expected:** with `Checked` unchanged, the switch stays in its prop-driven position.
- **Actual:** the switch optimistically flips `aria-checked` on click regardless of whether the bound `Checked` prop changes → visual state diverges from the C# source of truth (a real hazard for a safety toggle that must not appear "on" until confirmed).
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-075 (NSFW mode confirmation gate).
- **Workaround:** `@key="objNonce"` on the Switch, bump the nonce to force a re-render back to the source-of-truth on cancel/intercept.
- **Suggested fix:** honor the controlled `Checked` prop (don't hold optimistic internal state when `Checked` is bound).
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** `Switch` now honors the controlled prop at both layers. When a `CheckedChanged` consumer is attached (controlled), neither `Primitives.Switch.ToggleCheckedAsync` nor `Components.Switch.HandleCheckedChanged` flips internal state optimistically — they raise the callback and let the bound `Checked` drive the visual position, so an intercepted/gated toggle re-renders back to the source of truth. Uncontrolled use (no consumer) still toggles locally, so the headless primitive stays usable. Smoke (Blazor Server): a gated `<Switch Checked="@v" CheckedChanged="Intercept">` where `Intercept` leaves `v` unchanged stays `aria-checked="false"` after a click (bound value `False`), while an uncontrolled `<Switch>` correctly flips `false→true` (positive control that clicks were live). The `@key` nonce workaround is no longer needed.

### TR-010 — `DataTable` inner region can exceed a narrow (≤400px) viewport even inside an overflow-x scroll box
- **Severity:** minor
- **Repro:** a `<DataTable>` with several columns rendered on a ≤400px viewport, wrapped in an `overflow-x:auto` container (`.table-scroll`).
- **Expected:** the DataTable's own width is bounded by its container so ONLY the table body scrolls horizontally; the page body does not gain a residual horizontal overflow.
- **Actual:** the DataTable root (`.w-full.space-y-4` → `.rounded-md.border`) + its pagination footer keep a min-content wider than the viewport, leaving a small residual body overflow (~57px at 390px) even though `documentElement.scrollWidth` stays at the viewport width (no visible page scrollbar) and every control renders/fits. Purely cosmetic (dead space on the right); no control is clipped.
- **Encountered in:** REQ-UI-060 (Account recent-jobs table) and REQ-UI-074 (Model sources table). Non-table pages (UI-011/053) and other table pages fixed to `documentElement.scrollWidth==390` cleanly.
- **Workaround:** wrap the DataTable in `.table-scroll` (`overflow-x:auto; min-width:0`) + give the content column `min-width:0` — the table body then scrolls internally and no control is clipped (the primary defect). The ~57px residual dead-space scroll remains.
- **Suggested fix:** have `DataTable` set `min-width:0` on its own root wrapper and allow its pagination footer to wrap (`flex-wrap:wrap`) at narrow widths, so the component fully contains itself without a page-level wrapper.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):** applied both halves. `DataTable`'s root wrapper class is now `w-full min-w-0 space-y-4` (`min-w-0` lets the component shrink inside a narrow parent so only its inner `overflow-auto` region scrolls), and its pagination footer was already `flex flex-wrap`. Smoke at a 390px viewport (a 3-column table inside a 390px box): `document.documentElement.scrollWidth == clientWidth == 390` — the ~57px residual body overflow is gone, the footer wraps, and nothing is clipped. Consumers no longer need the `.table-scroll` page-level wrapper.

### TR-011 — packages ship a `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` FrameworkReference → MAUI Mac Catalyst head unbuildable (NETSDK1082)
- **Severity:** blocker (for the Mac Catalyst desktop delivery; Windows head and web head unaffected)
- **Repro:** `dotnet build src/TrStudio.Desktop -f net10.0-maccatalyst -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true` on a real Mac (Apple Silicon, .NET SDK 10.0.301, MAUI workload 10.0.20) with TrBlazeUI.{Components,Primitives,Icons.Lucide} 1.0.7 referenced via the `TrStudioUI` RCL.
- **Expected:** the packages are consumable from a MAUI Blazor Hybrid head on every MAUI TFM — a Blazor component library should depend on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web` as a *package*, not on the ASP.NET Core *shared framework*.
- **Actual:** all three 1.0.7 nupkgs carry `frameworkReferences: ["Microsoft.AspNetCore.App"]` (visible in the consuming app's `project.assets.json`), and no ASP.NET Core runtime pack exists for `maccatalyst-arm64` → `error NETSDK1082: There was no runtime pack for Microsoft.AspNetCore.App available for the specified RuntimeIdentifier 'maccatalyst-arm64'`. The Windows MAUI head escapes only because Windows runtime packs for the shared framework happen to exist. Discovered 2026-07-12 on the first build attempt on a real Mac — the earlier "Mac Catalyst compile 0/0" check (2026-07-05, from Windows) never reached runtime-pack resolution, so this stayed hidden.
- **Root cause (for the library team — the component CODE is fine, the packaging metadata is the defect):**
  - A Razor class library's compiled `net10.0` IL is platform-neutral and would run on Catalyst unchanged. The blocker is **one line of dependency metadata inside each published nupkg**. From `TrBlazeUI.Components.1.0.7.nupkg` → `TrBlazeUI.Components.nuspec`:
    ```xml
    <frameworkReferences>
      <group targetFramework="net10.0">
        <frameworkReference name="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
      </group>
    </frameworkReferences>
    ```
  - That declaration means *"any app referencing this package must supply the full ASP.NET Core shared framework"* (Kestrel, MVC, SignalR — the whole server runtime). NuGet propagates it transitively to every consuming app.
  - On a **Blazor Server** app the requirement is free (the app *is* an ASP.NET Core app). On the **Windows MAUI** head it happens to be satisfiable (ASP.NET Core runtime packs exist for Windows RIDs). On **Mac Catalyst / iOS / Android** Microsoft ships **no ASP.NET Core runtime pack at all**, so the requirement is unsatisfiable by any consumer — the build fails at dependency resolution, before any code compiles.
  - Blazor *components* never need the shared framework — everything they use lives in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web`, an ordinary platform-neutral NuGet package. Microsoft's guidance for component libraries that must also work in Blazor Hybrid / WebAssembly is explicit: **PackageReference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web`, never a `FrameworkReference` to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`**. (The FrameworkReference typically comes from the stock RCL template when the library once touched a server-side type — e.g. `AddRazorSupportForMvc`/`HtmlSanitizer`-adjacent server helpers — and it is invisible on Server/Windows, which is why it went unnoticed.)
- **Encountered in:** BRD-87 / REQ-FN-072 (MAUI Blazor Hybrid desktop heads — the Mac Catalyst delivery), first real-Mac run attempt per docs/TrStudio-BuildAndRun-Guide.md §3 Option A.
- **Workaround:** none shipped. Candidate app-side mitigation (unvalidated): strip the transitive framework reference for the maccatalyst TFM in `TrStudio.Desktop.csproj` via a target that removes the `TransitiveFrameworkReference` item `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` before `ProcessFrameworkReferences`; the proper fix belongs in the library (and the app-side strip would crash at runtime if any library code path really did call a server-only API — components almost certainly don't).
- **Suggested fix (concrete steps for the team):**
  1. In each of the three package projects (`TrBlazeUI.Primitives`, `TrBlazeUI.Components`, `TrBlazeUI.Icons.Lucide`): delete `<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />` and ensure `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web" />` covers everything used. If any type genuinely comes from the server framework (compile will say so), replace it with its package-shipped equivalent or isolate it behind a separate server-only package — do NOT put the FrameworkReference back on the component packages.
  2. `dotnet pack` → bump to **1.0.8**, push to the feed.
  3. **Verify the fix in the pipeline** (this is what kept 1.0.7's defect hidden): after pack, unzip the nupkg and assert the nuspec contains **no `<frameworkReferences>` block** — e.g. `unzip -p TrBlazeUI.Components.*.nupkg '*.nuspec' | grep -c frameworkReferences` must be 0. A "compiles on Windows" check can never catch this class of bug.
  4. **No Mac is required to build or pack the library** — it is a plain `net10.0` RCL; an `ubuntu-latest` GitHub Actions runner with the .NET 10 SDK builds, packs, and pushes it fine. Only *consuming apps'* Catalyst heads need macOS. For a full end-to-end proof in CI, add an optional job on a **`macos-14`/`macos-15` runner** (`dotnet workload install maui` is supported there) that restores a minimal `net10.0-maccatalyst` MAUI Blazor Hybrid consumer referencing the fresh packages — with 1.0.7 it fails NETSDK1082; with the fix it must pass restore/build.
- **✅ Resolution (2026-07-12, REQ-UI-015):**
  - **Root cause located in source:** `<AddRazorSupportForMvc>true</AddRazorSupportForMvc>` in both `TrBlazeUI.Components.csproj` and `TrBlazeUI.Primitives.csproj`. Enabling MVC Razor support is what makes the RCL build against the ASP.NET Core shared framework. These are Blazor component libraries — **no `.cshtml` and no MVC/server types** exist in either project (grep-confirmed), so MVC support was never needed. `Icons.Lucide` never had the flag.
  - **Fix:** removed `AddRazorSupportForMvc` from both projects (replaced with a comment documenting *why it must stay off* so it can't regress), leaving only the correct `PackageReference` to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web`.
  - **Pipeline verification (exactly step 3 above):** packed all three projects and asserted `unzip -p *.nupkg '*.nuspec' | grep -c frameworkReference == 0` — **Primitives = 0, Components = 0, Icons.Lucide = 0**. `Components.nuspec` now declares only platform-neutral package dependencies (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web`, `Blazor-ApexCharts`, `HtmlSanitizer`, `Markdig`, and the two inter-package refs) — no `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. A MAUI Mac Catalyst/iOS/Android consumer can therefore resolve these packages without NETSDK1082.
  - **Note on 1.0.7 vs. now:** the on-disk 1.0.9 nuspecs were already free of the `<frameworkReferences>` block, so the defect had regressed out sometime after the 1.0.7 that TrStudio consumed; this change eliminates the source-level flag that caused it and bakes the nuspec assertion into verification so it cannot silently return.
  - **Still owner's job:** bump the package versions (> 1.0.7) and push, so TrStudio can consume the clean packages.
