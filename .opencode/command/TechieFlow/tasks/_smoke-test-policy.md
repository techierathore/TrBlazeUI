# _smoke-test-policy (shared rule — included by every task that builds or verifies code)

## The rule

**Every code change is SMOKE-TESTED by the agent that made it, in this same session, BEFORE it is handed to the verifier or reported as "done".** A green `dotnet build` is NOT a smoke test — it proves the code compiles, not that the feature runs. No build phase chains to the verifier, and no agent says "implemented / done", with un-smoke-tested code. The owner should never have to discover at UAT that a feature was never actually run once.

A smoke test = boot the app (or the relevant host), exercise the changed feature once against the running app, and confirm it reaches the user without an unhandled exception. The per-phase tasks define the exact shape (`build-phase §6`, `fix-issues`, `devguide §5a`, `verify-phase`). This file defines the things every one of them must honor: **you run it yourself**, **you confirm the data actually renders**, **you confirm the screen actually looks right**, and **you use real test users**.

## "It runs" means the CONTROLS RENDER THEIR DATA *and* the screen LOOKS RIGHT — not just HTTP 200

A screen passes the smoke only if it clears **two** gates. Both have shipped real, damaging bugs:

**RENDER-TRUTH — the data is actually there.** A page that loads without an exception but shows a **blank table, a count badge over zero visible rows, an empty chart, or a blank value** is a FAILED smoke, not a pass (a home page whose details table is empty and whose list shows "16" over blank rows, shipped because the smoke only checked that the page opened). So:
- For **every data-bound control on the screen you touched** (grid/table/list, chart, detail/value panel), confirm it actually shows data: **rows present AND cells non-empty** (not just a count), chart/series non-empty, value not blank/placeholder. A control hidden by a `@if (x != null)` guard that never appears is render-empty, not "fine".
- A render-empty/blank control is a defect: log it to the owning `REQ-*` Remarks and do not report the screen "done"/`Verified`.

**VISUAL-TRUTH — the screen actually looks right.** Data being present is necessary but NOT sufficient. A screen where every control has its data but the controls **overlap each other, sit off-screen, are clipped to zero height, the layout is broken, or the UI renders unstyled** is a FAILED smoke — this is the exact "the verifier passed but the running UI is completely broken / controls overlapping" problem the framework exists to catch. So, for the screen you touched, at **desktop and a mobile width**:
- No two controls overlap (intersecting bounding boxes); every control is in-viewport with non-zero width and height; nothing is clipped or pushed off-canvas.
- Capture a screenshot and **look at it** — overlapping/stacked text, a broken grid, content overflowing its container, or raw unstyled HTML is a visual FAIL even if the geometry checks pass.
- ❌ "The data is present, so the screen is fine" is a **BANNED excuse** — a visually broken screen is a failed smoke regardless of data.
- A visual failure is a defect: log it to the owning `REQ-*` Remarks (prefix `⚠ visual:`) and route the fix to the UI builder (`/trblazeui`); do not report the screen "done"/`Verified`.

Where a DevGuide exists (`docs/{AppName}-DevGuide.md`, or the split set under `docs/devguides/`), it lists the controls each screen must render — use it as the per-control checklist. The verifier formalizes both gates: the **render gate** (`verify-phase.md §4a/§6`) and the **visual-truth gate** (`verify-phase.md §4b/§6`). A REQ is `Verified` only when it passes acceptance AND render-truth AND visual-truth.

This is the difference between "the method exists / the page compiled" and "the feature works". Only the latter — data present AND looking right — counts.

## "I can't run it here" is a BANNED excuse — the environment is already set up

The owner did the one-time setup (`WORKFLOW.html §0`) precisely so the agent can smoke-test without help. Two capabilities are PERMANENTLY available on the reference WSL-on-Windows machine:

- **Headless Playwright + system Chromium** are installed in WSL. Browser smoke tests run **headless** — no GUI, no display server needed. (`verify-phase.md §1` also self-heals them if a fresh machine is missing them.)
- **The MAUI / Windows-side dotnet bridge** exists (`build-invocation-ladder.md §B`, rungs #3–#4). Windows-targeted code and MAUI code **build AND run** on the right rung (`cmd.exe /c "dotnet run ..."` / `winrun`). WSL2 forwards `localhost`, so WSL-side Playwright reaches a Windows-side port.
- **The MAUI mobile/desktop runtime bridge** exists for any app that registers it (`core-config.yaml → runtimeVerification.appium`; one-time host setup `WORKFLOW.html §0b`; driver detail `build-invocation-ladder.md §D`). MAUI **Android** runs on an emulator on the Windows host; MAUI **iOS / Mac Catalyst** run on the LAN Mac — both driven over an **Appium** WebDriver endpoint that returns the same screenshot + element tree the gates consume. Appium is the native analogue of Playwright. The MAUI Windows head keeps its FlaUI/Appium-Windows path.

Therefore the following are **NOT acceptable reasons to skip the smoke and push the work onward un-tested.** Each maps to an already-solved capability — saying one of these means you skipped the setup, exactly like logging a wrong-rung build error as a "blocker":

- ❌ "I can't run the app on Linux / WSL."
- ❌ "This app targets Windows, so I can't run it from here."
- ❌ "It's a MAUI app — MAUI can't run on this system."
- ❌ "It's an Android / iOS / Mac Catalyst app — I can't run a mobile/desktop head from WSL." (If the app registered an Appium endpoint, drive it; if it didn't, log that it's unregistered and stamp the head `⚠ STATIC-ONLY` — never silently skip.)
- ❌ "Playwright needs a GUI / there's no browser here."
- ❌ "I'll let the verifier (or the user) smoke it."
- ❌ "The build passed, so it's fine."
- ❌ "It's a multi-service app — the API / DB / LLM endpoint it depends on is down, so I can't run it." (You bring those services up yourself — see below.)

**Escalating to the user is the LAST resort, not the first.** If WSL-side `dotnet run` can't be reached, switch to rung #4 (Windows-side) per the build ladder. If Playwright still can't connect after that, follow `verify-phase.md §3a` (try rung #4, try another port, THEN — only then — ask the user to run the two-line recipe and wait for `go`). Never propose a cloud deploy (banned per verify-phase's Local-only policy). You ask the user to boot the app **only after** the ladder genuinely fails — and you still run the smoke yourself once they reply `go`.

**A multi-service app does not change this — bring the dependent services up yourself.** When the feature needs an API + a web front-end + a database + an LLM endpoint, a dependent service being down is something you **start**, not a blocker you hand to the owner. Read each dependent project's `appsettings*.json` / launch settings for its configured port and URL, then start EACH service yourself **in dependency order** (DB/LLM endpoint first, then API, then web) via the build ladder before concluding you "can't run it". "The stack is down / it's multi-service" is the same banned excuse as "it can't run on Linux" — already-solved by booting the pieces.

**A MAUI mobile head does not change this either — boot the emulator + Appium yourself.** For a MAUI **Android** screen, starting the emulator and the Appium server on the Windows host is YOUR job (run the `runtimeVerification.appium.android.launch` command, e.g. via `winrun`; poll `…/status` until ready — emulators are slow to cold-start, so poll, don't give up). For **iOS / Mac Catalyst**, the LAN Mac's Appium must be reachable (`curl …/status`); that one is a genuine session dependency — if the Mac is down, stamp the head `⚠ STATIC-ONLY` and say so, never a faked pass. Asking the owner is still the LAST resort, after the boot-it-yourself escalation.

## Git is manual — NEVER run git to inspect code or chase a defect

This framework keeps **all** git activity manual: agents never run `git` or `gh` — not to commit, and **not to read**. Do NOT reach for `git diff` / `git log` / `git status` / `git blame` to see "what changed" or to investigate a bug while smoking, verifying, observing, or mapping code. The owner has deliberately gated git behind a manual approval and will deny the prompt — which only stalls you mid-task. Investigate by **reading the working-tree files** at their paths: the files on disk ARE the as-built code, and a finding's evidence is the `file:line` you read, never a diff. (`refresh-status` was de-git-ed for exactly this reason — see `WorkFlow-Context.md`; status/recovery is reconstructed from the checklist tables + files-on-disk + a fresh `dotnet build`, never from commit history.)

## Test users — use the documented/existing ones; NEVER auto-create random smoke users

Smoke and verify runs that create throwaway accounts (`smoketest_user_8472`, `test@test.test`, randomly-named users) **pollute the database** and are banned. The agent has DB access (the connection string lives in `appsettings*.json` / environment config) — use it to find real accounts instead of inventing them. Resolve test credentials in THIS order and stop at the first that works:

1. **`docs/{AppName}-UsageGuide.md` → the "Test users" table** is the canonical registry. Use an account listed there (matching the role the feature needs).
2. **If that account isn't created yet, or there is no UsageGuide:** query the **database directly** with the connection string from config. Read the users/identity table; reuse a suitable existing account. (Read-only — you're looking up credentials, not mutating data.)
3. **If neither yields a usable account: STOP and ASK the user.** Show what you need and what you'd create, e.g. — *"I need an Admin test user to smoke REQ-FN-7. The DB has no admin account and the UsageGuide lists none. Either give me credentials to use, or confirm I should create: `admin@{app}.test` / `Pass!23` (Admin). Create it? (y/n)"* — and wait. Do not proceed on a guess.
4. **Only after explicit confirmation,** create the user(s) — then **record them in `docs/{AppName}-UsageGuide.md`'s Test users table** (mark `Created? = ✅`) so the next phase and the verifier reuse the SAME accounts instead of making new ones.

NEVER invent a throwaway user mid-smoke. NEVER create accounts without the user's confirmation. The UsageGuide Test-users table is the single source of truth for test accounts — every smoke, every verify, and the human UAT all draw from it, so the DB stays clean and reproducible.
