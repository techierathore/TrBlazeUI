# verify-phase

Autonomously verify implemented requirements against their numbered REQ IDs. The AGENT performs every step itself in its own shell. The user runs nothing.

## Purpose

Replace manual verification. Given a scope, prove whether each numbered requirement is actually implemented and behaving, by running real headless browser tests and unit tests against the running application. Verdicts are written into the owning checklist's Requirements Status table (the single source of truth) plus a console miss list.

## Inputs

- `{AppName}` — required for the checklist path; resolve from the command argument, `core-config.yaml` → `customTechnicalDocuments`, or the `docs/{AppName}-Checklist.md` filename. Ask only if it cannot be resolved.
- `{scope}` — see Modes.
- **The DevGuide** (`docs/{AppName}-DevGuide.md`, or the split set under `docs/devguides/`) — the screen-by-screen, **per-control** test map. The verifier uses it to know which controls each screen must render (the render gate, §4a). If it is missing, the verifier still runs but notes that no control map exists and recommends `*devguide {AppName}`; if it exists, the verifier **refreshes its observed render-status tags** for every screen it exercises (§6b) — this is the DevGuide ⇄ Checklist ⇄ Verifier loop.

## Modes

- **Full mode** (default, `*verify {scope}`): run the entire pipeline below. There is **one checklist** (`docs/{AppName}-Checklist.md`); scopes filter its Requirements Status table by REQ prefix, they do NOT pick a separate file. Scope values:
  - `ui` — all `REQ-UI-*` rows.
  - `functional` — all `REQ-FN-*` / `REQ-NFR-*` / `REQ-RAG-*` rows.
  - `all` — every row.
  - An explicit ID list (`REQ-UI-007,REQ-UI-013`) — just those rows.
  - `phase-N` — LEGACY fallback for pre-split projects: grade the BRD's Phase-N numbered IDs (see §0 legacy path).
- **Setup-only mode** (`*setup`): execute only Section 1, then HALT.

## Local-only deployment policy (CRITICAL — read before every run)

The verifier MUST run the application **LOCALLY**. Never propose, suggest, or initiate any of the following to "make Playwright work":

- Cloudflare / Cloudflare Pages / Cloudflare Tunnels
- Vercel / Netlify / Render / Fly.io
- Azure App Service / AWS / GCP / any cloud deploy
- Pushing to a remote branch so a preview environment builds
- Asking the user to "deploy somewhere I can reach"

The user runs Claude Code on their own machine. Local boot is always possible. If you find yourself drafting "let me deploy this to X first" — STOP, that is a banned escape hatch. The user has explicitly called this out as an "idiotic option" — do not repeat it.

**Local device hosts are NOT cloud.** Driving the MAUI Android head via the Appium server on the **Windows host** and the MAUI iOS / Mac Catalyst heads via the Appium server on the **LAN Mac** (`runtimeVerification.appium` in `core-config.yaml`, see §3b) is local infrastructure the owner set up once (`WORKFLOW.html §0b`) — it is the native analogue of headless Playwright, not a remote deploy. Use it. Only the cloud-deploy escape hatches above are banned.

If the WSL-side `dotnet run` is unreachable by Playwright (port collision, WSL networking quirks, missing browser deps), the correct escalation order is:

1. **Try a different rung of the build invocation ladder.** Rung #4 `cmd.exe /c "dotnet run --project ..."` launches Windows-side dotnet on a Windows-side port; that port IS reachable from WSL Playwright via the WSL host IP (`$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}')` or `host.docker.internal` analog). Try this BEFORE asking the user anything.
2. **Try a different port** if rung #2 is on a busy port (5099 → 5599).
3. **Ask the user to run it locally themselves.** Output the EXACT two-line shell recipe and a `go` prompt:

   ```
   I can't reach the app from Playwright in this environment. Please run these two
   commands in separate terminals on the Windows side (or in your usual dev setup):

     Terminal 1 (API):  dotnet run --project src/{AppName}.Api --urls http://localhost:5100
     Terminal 2 (Web):  dotnet run --project src/{AppName}.Web --urls http://localhost:5099

   When both show "Now listening on", reply `go` and I'll run the verifier against
   those URLs.
   ```

   Wait for `go`. Then point Playwright at `http://localhost:5099` (and `http://localhost:5100` for API checks). Do NOT skip verification. Do NOT propose cloud anything.

This applies to EVERY phase task that boots an app (the `build-phase` self-smoke, the `fix-issues` repro, the `devguide` OBSERVE pass, and this verifier). They all share this policy.

## SEQUENTIAL Execution (do not proceed until current section is complete)

### 0. Load inputs and build the working list

- Load `.tfcore/core-config.yaml`; resolve `{AppName}` per Inputs above. Note any `runtimeVerification.appium` endpoints — they tell you which MAUI native heads (Android/iOS/Mac Catalyst) this app ships and how to reach them (§3b).
- Determine the scope from the command argument (`ui` / `functional` / `all` / explicit REQ IDs / legacy `phase-N`). **When this task is chained from `build-phase` or `fix-issues`, the caller has already stated the scope — use it and ask nothing.** Only if invoked standalone with NO scope: ask the user once "Verify which scope — ui, functional, all, or specific REQ IDs?" — this is the ONLY question you may ask.
- **Checklist path (normal):** open the one checklist `docs/{AppName}-Checklist.md`. From the **Requirements Status** table, filter rows by the scope's REQ prefix (`REQ-UI-*` for `ui`; `REQ-FN/NFR/RAG-*` for `functional`; all rows for `all`) and build the working list `[{id, text, status, type-guess}]` (type-guess ∈ {ui, behavioral, backend-logic, nonfunctional}; pull each REQ's acceptance criteria from its Details anchor section).
- **`Done (pre-existing)` is NOT a free pass — it is an unverified migrated claim.** Do NOT skip those rows. They were carried over from a dev-plan and have **never been runtime-verified** — this is exactly how blank-rendering screens slipped through (a `Done (pre-existing)` home page with an empty table and a blank list). Every in-scope row, **including `Done (pre-existing)`**, gets the **§4a DevGuide render sweep** at minimum (load its screens, confirm every control actually renders its data). Only `N/A` rows are skipped. Rows already `Verified` get a fast re-confirm (render sweep + re-run their test); `Done (pre-existing)` that passes the render sweep gets a `runtime render-confirmed {date}` remark and may stay Done; anything that renders blank/empty/errors → `Needs re-verify`/`FAIL` (§6).
- **Load the DevGuide map.** Read the DevGuide (`docs/{AppName}-DevGuide.md`, or the split set under `docs/devguides/`) and, for each in-scope screen, extract the list of controls + their expected data source from the *Controls*/*Data lineage* tables. This is the checklist of what must render in §4a. If no DevGuide exists, note it and fall back to acceptance-criteria-only grading, and recommend `*devguide {AppName}` in the report.
- **Legacy BRD path (only for `phase-N` scope on pre-split projects):** locate the BRD (`customTechnicalDocuments`, then `docs/{AppName}-BRD*.md`, then `docs/brd*.md`/`docs/BRD*.md`) and extract that phase's numbered IDs (`BRD-12`, `REQ-12`, `FR-12`, `[BRD-12]`). If no numbered IDs exist, STOP auto-grading and tell the user: "This phase has no numbered, checkable requirements, so coverage cannot be graded by ID. Number them as BRD-N (or run `*split-brd`) and re-run." Then offer a loose best-effort prose verification.
- If the working list is empty (all rows `N/A`), report "Nothing to verify — all rows N/A" and skip to §8. (Note: `Verified` and `Done (pre-existing)` rows are NOT empty-list — they still get the §4a render sweep.)

### 1. Ensure the verification environment (self-healing)

Run these checks yourself and act on them. Echo a one-line summary of what you did.

- If no `package.json` in repo root: `npm init -y`.
- Check Playwright: run `npx playwright --version`. If it errors or is absent: `npm install -D @playwright/test`.
- Check browsers: attempt `npx playwright install chromium`. If it reports missing system libraries (common on a fresh WSL/Ubuntu): run `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. If that needs sudo and sudo is unavailable, run `sudo npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`; if sudo also fails, report the single apt command the user must run once and HALT (this is the only situation where a manual step is unavoidable, and it happens at most once per machine).
- Ensure a minimal `playwright.config.ts` exists at repo root. If absent, create one with: testDir `./tests/verify`, `use: { screenshot: 'only-on-failure', trace: 'retain-on-failure', headless: true }`, and `reporter: 'line'`.
- In SETUP-ONLY mode: print "Verification environment ready." and HALT here.

### 2. Locate and characterize the Blazor app

- Find the startup `*.csproj` (the one referencing `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` or a Blazor SDK; if multiple, prefer one named like `*.Web`, `*.Server`, `*.App`, else ask once).
- Read `Properties/launchSettings.json` for `applicationUrl`. Capture both the https and http URLs. **Prefer the http URL** for testing to avoid dev-cert friction in WSL. If only https is exposed, run `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` (best-effort) and fall back to http if the cert blocks navigation.
- Note whether it is Blazor Server (SignalR — needs explicit waits) or WASM (slower first paint).

### 3. Boot the app headless in the background

- **Pick the right rung first** — read the startup `.csproj`. If it targets a MAUI **Android / iOS / Mac Catalyst** head (`<UseMaui>` + `-android`/`-ios`/`-maccatalyst`) → this section (Playwright boot) does not apply; jump to **§3b** to drive it over Appium. The MAUI **Windows** head builds/runs via rung #4 (`cmd.exe /c "dotnet run ..."`) and is driven by FlaUI/Appium-Windows as before. Otherwise (Blazor) rung #2 (`~/.dotnet/dotnet run --project ...`).
- Start it yourself, detached, capturing logs:
  `nohup ~/.dotnet/dotnet run --project <csproj> --urls http://localhost:5099 > .verify/app.log 2>&1 &`
  (Pin a known free port like 5099 so the test URL is deterministic. Create `.verify/` if needed.)
- Poll `http://localhost:5099` (curl, up to ~60s) until it returns HTTP 200, or until `app.log` shows "Now listening on".
- If the log shows `NETSDK1178` / workload missing / `Microsoft.iOS.Sdk missing` → you picked the wrong rung. Kill the process, switch to rung #4, retry.

### 3a. Boot-failure fallback — ASK USER, never propose cloud

If the boot doesn't succeed in 60s, OR Playwright cannot connect to it (e.g. WSL networking blocks the WSL→localhost lookup):

1. Capture the last 30 lines of `.verify/app.log` and read them. If the error is fixable (port already in use → pick another port; missing dev cert → http only) — retry once.
2. Try rung #4 of the build invocation ladder: `cmd.exe /c "cd C:\\path\\to\\project && dotnet run --project src\\{AppName}.Web --urls http://localhost:5099"`. Detached, log to `.verify/app.log`. This launches Windows-side dotnet which Playwright in WSL can reach via `http://localhost:5099` (WSL2 forwards localhost to the Windows host).
3. If both fail, fall through to the **ask-user flow** (per the "Local-only deployment policy" at the top of this file). Output the two-terminal shell recipe. **Wait for `go`** and proceed.

**NEVER**: propose cloud deploy, propose skipping verification, propose "let me push to staging", propose "let me deploy to Cloudflare Pages so Playwright can reach it." Banned escape hatches.

### 3b. MAUI native heads — drive with Appium, not Playwright

§3/§3a boot a **Blazor** app for **Playwright**. A MAUI **Android / iOS / Mac Catalyst** screen has no browser — it is driven over the **Appium** WebDriver endpoint instead. Appium is the native analogue of Playwright: it returns a `base64` screenshot (for §4b) and an element tree with `rect` + text + page source (for §4a), so **the §4a render gate and §4b visual-truth gate run unchanged — only the driver differs.** The MAUI **Windows** head keeps its existing FlaUI / Appium-Windows path (out of scope here); Blazor keeps Playwright.

Trigger: the startup/owning `.csproj` has `<UseMaui>` / MAUI SDK and a `-android` / `-ios` / `-maccatalyst` target framework. For each such head in scope:

1. **Resolve the endpoint** from `core-config.yaml → runtimeVerification.appium.{android|ios|maccatalyst}`. If the app didn't register that head, note "no Appium endpoint configured for {head}" and stamp the head `⚠ STATIC-ONLY` (do NOT fake a pass); tell the user in §8 to add it per `WORKFLOW.html §0b`.
2. **Bring the device host up yourself** (boot-it-yourself rule, same as §3):
   - **Android** — run the registry `launch` command (e.g. `winrun "powershell -File start-android-verify.ps1"`) to start the emulator (`avd`) + Appium on the Windows host; then poll `curl http://localhost:4723/status` (Win11 mirrored networking → `localhost`) until `{"ready":true}` (emulator cold start can take minutes — poll, don't assume).
   - **iOS / Mac Catalyst** — the LAN Mac runs Appium; `curl http://<mac>:4723/status`. You do **not** start the Mac; if it is unreachable, that is a session dependency → stamp the head `⚠ STATIC-ONLY` with "Mac build host unreachable" and continue with the heads you can reach. Never mark those REQs `Verified` on visual grounds you couldn't observe.
3. **Build + install + launch the app on the device** via the build ladder runtime-observe leg (`build-invocation-ladder.md §D`): Android via rung #4 (`cmd.exe`), iOS/Catalyst on the Mac. Start an Appium session with the right driver (`uiautomator2` / `xcuitest` / `mac2`) pointed at the built `.apk`/`.app`.
4. Hand the live session to §4a/§4b: the fan-out subagents target this Appium session (selectors by `AutomationId` per the coding standard) instead of a Playwright `baseURL`. Screenshots land under `test-results/` exactly as Playwright's do.

If a head genuinely can't be reached after this escalation, it is `⚠ STATIC-ONLY` for that head — never a faked `Verified`. Tear the Appium session + any emulator you started down in §7.

### 4. Generate / refresh tests from the scoped requirement IDs (PARALLEL FAN-OUT)

**Test users (per `.tfcore/tasks/_smoke-test-policy.md`):** any test that needs a logged-in user MUST use a documented/existing account — first from `docs/{AppName}-UsageGuide.md`'s Test-users table, else looked up from the database via the connection string in `appsettings*.json`. **NEVER auto-create random verify/smoke users** (that pollutes the DB). If no usable account exists, STOP and ask the user to provide or confirm credentials before creating any — then record the created account in the UsageGuide table. Pass the chosen credentials into each subagent prompt so all tests share the same accounts.

**Single-agent test generation is a banned anti-pattern for the verifier too** — splits cleanly along test-type lines.

Group the working list by `type-guess`:

- **Cluster UI** — all `ui` / `behavioral` IDs (Playwright tests).
- **Cluster API** — all `backend-logic` IDs with HTTP surface (Playwright `page.request` or dotnet test integration tests).
- **Cluster Unit** — all `backend-logic` / `nonfunctional` IDs without HTTP surface (dotnet unit tests).

For each non-empty cluster, spawn a parallel `Agent` (subagent_type=general-purpose) in ONE assistant turn. Each subagent prompt MUST include:
- The cluster's REQ IDs + requirement text.
- The running app URL (`http://localhost:5099` or whatever §3/§3a resolved to).
- Path to where the test files should land: `tests/verify/{scope}-{cluster}.spec.ts` (Playwright; scope slug = `ui` / `functional` / `req-list` / `phase-N`) or appropriate `*Tests.csproj` for dotnet tests.
- Black-box rule: do NOT touch application source.
- Return contract: `{ testsAdded[], testsRefreshed[], unobservable[] }`.

After all subagents return, you (the verifier) own running the tests in §5. Do NOT have subagents run tests — concurrent test runs against one running app would race.

Per-requirement guidance for subagents:

- **ui / behavioral** → one `test()` per requirement, title PREFIXED with the ID, e.g. `test('BRD-12 user can filter the grid by status', ...)`. Use Playwright auto-waiting plus explicit `await page.waitForSelector(...)` for Blazor Server render/SignalR. Assert the observable outcome the requirement describes.
- **backend-logic / nonfunctional** → if a `*Tests.csproj` exists, ensure a matching unit/integration test is present (do not rewrite existing passing tests; only flag absence). If no test project exists, mark the requirement `NOT-OBSERVABLE` rather than guessing.
- Reference the running URL as `baseURL`.
- Keep tests black-box and idempotent.

### 4a. DevGuide render sweep — the STRICT RENDER GATE (run for every in-scope screen)

Acceptance tests check "does the feature behave"; this sweep checks the thing that actually slips through — **"does every control on the screen actually render its data, or is it blank?"** A page that returns HTTP 200 with an empty table, a count badge over zero visible rows, or a chart with no data is a DEFECT, not a pass. This is what the verifier missed before.

For **every in-scope screen** in the DevGuide map (including those backing `Done (pre-existing)` and `Verified` REQs), generate/refresh a Playwright check (fan out by role-cluster like §4) that:
- Logs in as the role that reaches the screen (use the DevGuide's stated role + the `_smoke-test-policy.md` test user), navigates to the screen's route.
- For **each control the DevGuide lists** for that screen, asserts it actually rendered its data:
  - grids/tables/lists → **row count > 0 AND cells are non-empty** (catch the "count says 16 but rows blank" case: assert visible data cells, not just the count badge);
  - charts → the chart/SVG/series node exists and is non-empty;
  - detail/value panels → the value element is present and not blank/placeholder;
  - a control hidden behind a null guard (`@if (X != null)`) that never appears → **render-empty**, not "absent by design", unless the DevGuide says it's conditional.
- Record per control: **RENDERS** / **RENDER-EMPTY** (blank, zero-rows, count-vs-rows mismatch, null-guarded-away) / **RENDER-ERROR** (console/Blazor error) / **UNREACHABLE** (route/auth failed).

A screen with any RENDER-EMPTY / RENDER-ERROR control **fails the render gate** for every REQ that owns a control on it (§6). Capture a screenshot for each failing control. These observations are also what feed the DevGuide refresh in §6b — the DevGuide's render-status tags become *observed runtime facts*, not static inferences.

**For MAUI native heads (§3b),** run the identical assertions over the **Appium** session instead of Playwright: locate each control by its `AutomationId`, read the element's text / child count from the page source (grid rows non-empty, value non-blank), and treat a missing/empty element exactly as RENDER-EMPTY. Same verdicts, same screenshots — only the locator API changes.

### 4b. VISUAL-TRUTH gate — does the screen actually LOOK right (run for every in-scope screen)

The §4a render gate proves the data is *present in the DOM*; it does NOT prove the screen is *usable*. The exact failure the owner hit: every control renders its data, the verifier passes — but the controls **overlap, sit off-screen, are clipped to zero height, or the layout is broken**, so the running app is unusable. "Has data" ≠ "looks right." This gate closes that hole.

For **every in-scope screen** (same screens as §4a, same role login), at **at least two viewport widths** — desktop (1280×800) and mobile (390×844) — assert via Playwright:
- **No overlap:** no two sibling/interactive controls have intersecting bounding boxes (`boundingBox()` rectangles must not overlap beyond a small tolerance). Overlapping controls = `VISUAL-FAIL`.
- **In-viewport & sized:** every control the DevGuide lists has a bounding box with width > 0 and height > 0, and lies within the page bounds (not pushed off-canvas, not clipped to 0). A control with a zero-size or off-screen box = `VISUAL-FAIL`.
- **Not occluded / not collapsed:** key containers are not zero-height and content is not spilling out of its container.
- **Screenshot + vision:** capture a full-page screenshot at each width and **inspect it** — broken grid, stacked/overlapping text, unstyled fallback (raw HTML with no TrBlazeUI styling), or content overflowing its region is a `VISUAL-FAIL` even if the box-geometry checks passed.
- **Mockup diff (greenfield, when a mockup exists):** compare the screen against its mockup (`docs/mockups/{screen}.html` named in the REQ's checklist row). The same regions/controls should be present in roughly the same layout. A large structural deviation = `MOCKUP-DRIFT` (a `VISUAL-FAIL` sub-type); a match = `MOCKUP-MATCH`. Brownfield has no mockup — rely on the geometry + vision checks (and, where present, the reviewed DevGuide screenshots from `docs/screenshots/{AppName}/`).

Record per screen: **VISUAL-OK** / **VISUAL-FAIL** (with the failing controls + which width + a screenshot path) / **MOCKUP-DRIFT**. A screen with any `VISUAL-FAIL` fails the visual gate for every REQ that owns a control on it (§6). These observations also feed the DevGuide refresh (§6b).

**For MAUI native heads (§3b),** run the identical overlap / in-viewport / sized / screenshot-inspection checks over the **Appium** session: `element.rect` gives each control's bounding box (overlap + zero-size + off-screen detection), and `driver.get_screenshot_as_base64()` gives the full-screen image to inspect. Drive the device's natural size plus, where the simulator/emulator supports it, a phone vs tablet/desktop variant. Same `VISUAL-OK` / `VISUAL-FAIL` verdicts.

### 5. Run the tests

- Playwright: `npx playwright test --reporter=line`.
- Unit/integration (if a test project exists): `dotnet test --nologo`.
- Collect: per-test pass/fail, and for FAILURES only, the screenshot path under `test-results/` and the relevant assertion message. Do not open artifacts for passing tests.

### 6. Build the coverage matrix AND write it into the Status table

Map every requirement ID to exactly one verdict:

- `PASS` — a real test for this ID passed against the running app / a unit test passed, **AND** every control the DevGuide attributes to this REQ's screens passed the §4a render gate **AND** the §4b visual-truth gate.
- `RENDER-FAIL` — the acceptance behavior may work, but at least one of the REQ's controls is **RENDER-EMPTY / RENDER-ERROR** (blank table, count-vs-rows mismatch, empty chart, blank value, Blazor error). Include the control + screenshot. This is a real defect even if an old status said `Done`.
- `VISUAL-FAIL` — the data renders, but the screen does not LOOK right: controls overlap, sit off-viewport, are clipped to zero size, the layout is broken/unstyled, or it drifts structurally from its mockup (§4b). Include the failing control(s), the width, and a screenshot. A real defect even if §4a passed and an old status said `Done`.
- `FAIL` — a test for this ID ran and failed (include the one-line reason + screenshot path).
- `NOT-IMPLEMENTED` — feature/element the requirement needs was absent (test could not even find it).
- `NOT-OBSERVABLE` — backend/nonfunctional requirement with no test project to assert it; needs a human or a test to be written.

**STRICT GATE (non-negotiable):** a REQ may be `Verified` **only if** its acceptance test passes AND all its DevGuide-listed controls RENDER their data (§4a) AND every screen it owns passes VISUAL-TRUTH (§4b). Never mark `Verified` when any owned control is RENDER-EMPTY/RENDER-ERROR or any owned screen is VISUAL-FAIL — those are the exact failure modes these gates exist to stop (data-present-but-blank, and data-present-but-visually-broken). A `Done (pre-existing)` REQ whose screens pass both gates stays `Done (pre-existing)` with a `runtime render+visual-confirmed {date}` remark; one that fails either drops to `Needs re-verify`.

Then **write each verdict into the Requirements Status table** of the one checklist `docs/{AppName}-Checklist.md` (find the row by its REQ ID). This is the single source of truth; there are no dated coverage files. Update only the Status / % / Remarks cells (never the requirement text or app source). Map verdict → table Status:

| Verdict | Status | % | Remark |
|---------|--------|---|--------|
| PASS | `Verified` | 100% | date + test path + `render+visual gate: all controls render and look right` |
| RENDER-FAIL | `Needs re-verify` | lower to reflect reality | date + `⚠ render gate: {control} renders empty/error on {screen}` + screenshot path |
| VISUAL-FAIL | `Needs re-verify` | lower to reflect reality | date + `⚠ visual: {control(s)} overlap/clip/off-viewport on {screen} @ {width}` (or `⚠ visual: drifts from mockup`) + screenshot path |
| FAIL | `FAIL` | keep | date + one-line reason + screenshot path |
| FAIL caused by a library gap | `Blocked` | keep | date + link the `TR-NNN` entry in `docs/{AppName}-TrBlazeUI-Feedback.md` or the `TR-RAG-NNN` entry in `docs/{AppName}-TechieRag-Feedback.md` (add the entry if the implementing agent didn't — one feedback file per library) |
| NOT-IMPLEMENTED | `In Progress` | 25% | date + "element/feature absent" |
| NOT-OBSERVABLE | `N/A` | — | date + "no test surface; needs human/test" |

A FAIL counts as "caused by a library gap" when the failing behavior traces to TrBlazeUI/TechieRag rather than app code (matches an entry in the owning library's feedback file, or your diagnosis pins it on the library). `Blocked` rows pass through phase-completion checks — they are not the app's fault.

If a graded ID has no row in the Status table yet, add one.

### 6b. Refresh the DevGuide render-status (close the loop)

For every screen you exercised, update its entry in the DevGuide (`docs/{AppName}-DevGuide.md`, or the matching role file under `docs/devguides/`) so its control render-status reflects **what you just observed at runtime** — not the old static inference:
- Tag each control **renders ✓ (runtime-confirmed {date})** / **renders-empty (DEFECT — {what}, {date})** / **render-error** / **unreachable**, matching the §4a sweep, and add the §4b visual result for the screen **looks-right ✓ (runtime-confirmed {date})** / **visual-broken (DEFECT — {what} @ {width}, {date})**.
- Update/refresh the screen's *Known issues* with any new RENDER-EMPTY/ERROR **or VISUAL-FAIL** finding (with file refs if known), and clear ones that now render and look right.
- Stamp the DevGuide file header (or the screen block) `Runtime-verified {date} as {roles exercised}`. If a screen could not be reached/booted, mark it `NOT RUNTIME-VERIFIED` rather than leaving a stale "renders" claim.
- This is markdown only — do NOT render the checklists to HTML; DO re-render the touched DevGuide `.html` via `.tfcore/tasks/generate-html.md` (it is a human doc).

If no DevGuide exists, skip this and add to the report: "No DevGuide to refresh — run `*devguide {AppName}` to create the control map, then re-verify."

### 7. Tear down

- Kill the app process you started (by the pinned port / stored PID). Confirm the port is free.
- For MAUI native heads (§3b): quit the Appium session, and shut down any **emulator** you started yourself (leave a pre-existing/owner-run emulator or the LAN Mac's Appium server up — only tear down what you booted).

### 8. Report and HALT

Print a compact report (you have already updated the checklist Status table in §6; do NOT modify requirement text or app source):

```
# Verification — {scope}
Source checklist(s): <path(s)>   |   Requirements graded: N

| ID      | Requirement (short)        | Status          | Evidence                          |

| BRD-10  | ...                        | PASS            | tests/verify/phase-2.spec.ts      |
| BRD-12  | ...                        | FAIL            | screenshot: test-results/.../...png — "expected grid rows > 0" |

| BRD-14  | ...                        | NOT-OBSERVABLE  | no test project; logic-only       |

## MISS LIST (act on these)
- BRD-12 FAIL — <one line>
- BRD-13 NOT-IMPLEMENTED — <one line>

## Summary: PASS x / FAIL y / BLOCKED b / NOT-IMPLEMENTED z / NOT-OBSERVABLE w

- The per-REQ detail now lives in the checklist Status table (§6) — do NOT also save a dated `docs/verify/*.md` report. The console report above plus the updated Status table ARE the deliverable.
- **FINAL GATE — update PROJECT-STATUS (MANDATORY, non-skippable).** Before you HALT, update PROJECT-STATUS — **both `PROJECT-STATUS.md` AND re-rendered `PROJECT-STATUS.html`** — per `.tfcore/tasks/_status-update-gate.md`: `last_updated`, `last_verified_build`/`last_verified_date`, sync Open requirements to the Status table (anything not `Verified` stays open), set the Next command (**command-against-checklist only — re-run the phase naming the FAILed REQ IDs if there are FAILs; advance if all `Verified` — no prose to-do narrative**), and add a verification-log row pointing at the checklist's `#requirements-status`. **Record this run's outcome as that ONE Verification-log row + the per-REQ Remarks you wrote in the checklist (§6) — do NOT add a `## *verify all — coverage matrix (date)` section (or any new H2) to PROJECT-STATUS; it is a fixed-shape snapshot you overwrite, never an append-log (see `_status-update-gate.md`).** A verification run that updates the markdown but not the HTML, or that does not update PROJECT-STATUS at all, is incomplete.
- Do not fix source. If the user wants fixes, that is a separate instruction to the dev/orchestrator agent referencing the miss list.
- HALT.

## Key principles

- The user typed one command. You did everything else.
- Grade only against numbered IDs; never inflate coverage.
- **A feature is not "done" until its UI renders its data AND looks right.** Behaves-correctly AND renders-its-data (§4a) AND looks-right (§4b) are ALL required for `Verified`. HTTP 200 with a blank table is a FAIL; data-present-but-overlapping/clipped/off-screen is also a FAIL. This is the gap that let "verified" screens be visibly broken.
- **`Done (pre-existing)` is an unverified claim, not a pass** — it gets the render sweep like everything else. The first runtime pass either confirms it or flags it.
- **Close the loop:** the DevGuide is your control map (§0/§4a) and you write your runtime observations back into it (§6b). DevGuide ⇄ Checklist ⇄ Verifier stay in sync; a build phase marking a REQ done → this verifier → updated checklist + DevGuide → repeat.
- Results go in the checklist Status table + PROJECT-STATUS (+ the DevGuide render tags) — never a separate dated file.
- Lean context: read failures, ignore successes, tear down what you booted.
